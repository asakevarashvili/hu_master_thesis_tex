  abstract = {Homeostatic and circadian processes collaborate to appropriately time and consolidate sleep and wake. To understand how these processes are integrated, we scheduled brief sleep deprivation at different times of day in               Drosophila               and find elevated morning rebound compared to evening. These effects depend on discrete morning and evening clock neurons, independent of their roles in circadian locomotor activity. In the R5 ellipsoid body sleep homeostat, we identified elevated morning expression of activity dependent and presynaptic gene expression as well as the presynaptic protein BRUCHPILOT consistent with regulation by clock circuits. These neurons also display elevated calcium levels in response to sleep loss in the morning, but not the evening consistent with the observed time-dependent sleep rebound. These studies reveal the circuit and molecular mechanisms by which discrete circadian clock neurons program a homeostatic sleep center.},

  abstract = {1. Calcium currents were recorded with whole-cell voltage-clamp procedures in relay neurones of the rat thalamus which had been acutely isolated by an enzymatic dissociation procedure. 2. Low-threshold and high-threshold Ca2+ currents were elicited by depolarizing voltage steps from holding potentials more negative than -60 mV. A transient current, analogous to the T-current in sensory neurones, was activated at low threshold near -65 mV and was completely inactivating at command steps up to -35 mV. Voltage steps to more depolarized levels activated a high-threshold current that inactivated slowly and incompletely during a 200 ms step depolarization. 3. The high-threshold current contained both non-inactivating and slowly inactivating components which were insensitive and sensitive to holding potential, respectively. 4. A 'T-type' current was prominent in relay neurones, in both absolute terms (350 pA peak current average) and in relation to high-threshold currents. The average ratio of maximum transient to maximum sustained current was greater than 2. 5. T-current could be modelled in a manner analogous to that employed for the fast Na+ current underlying action potential generation, using the m3h format. The rate of activation of T-current was voltage dependent, with a time constant (tau m) varying between 8 and 2 ms at command potentials of -60 to -10 mV at 23 degrees C. The rate of inactivation was also voltage dependent, and the time constant tau h varied between 50 and 20 ms over the same voltage range. With command potentials more positive than -35 mV, the inactivation of Ca2+ current could no longer be fitted by a single exponential. 6. Steady-state inactivation of T-current could be well fitted by a Boltzman equation with slope factor of 6.3 and half-inactivated voltage of -83.5 mV. 7. Recovery from inactivation of T-current was not exponential. The major component of recovery (70-80\% of total) was not very voltage sensitive at potentials more negative than -90 mV, with tau r of 251 ms at -92 mV and 23 degrees C, compared to 225 ms at -112 mV. A smaller, voltage-sensitive component accounted for the remainder of recovery. 8. All kinetic properties, including rates of activation, inactivation, and recovery from inactivation, as well as the amplitude of T-current, were temperature sensitive with Q10 (temperature coefficient) values of greater than 2.5.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {The low-threshold calcium current (IT) underlies burst generation in thalamocortical (TC) relay cells and plays a central role in the genesis of synchronized oscillations by thalamic circuits. Here we have combined in vitro recordings and computational modeling techniques to investigate the consequences of dendritically located IT in TC cells. Simulations of a reconstructed TC cell were compared with the recordings obtained in the same cell to constrain the values of its passive parameters. T-current densities in soma and proximal dendrites were then estimated by matching the model to voltage-clamp recordings obtained in dissociated TC cells, which lack most of the dendrites. The distal dendritic T-current density was constrained by recordings in intact TC cells, which show 5-14 times larger peak T-current amplitudes compared with dissociated cells. Comparison of the model with the recordings of the same cell constrained further the T-current density in dendrites, which had to be 4.5-7.6 times higher than in the soma to reproduce all experimental results. Similar conclusions were reached using a simplified three-compartment model. Functionally, the model shows that the same amount of T-channels can lead to different bursting behaviors if they are exclusively somatic or distributed throughout the dendrites. In conclusion, this combination of models and experiments shows that dendritic T-currents are necessary to reproduce low-threshold calcium electrogenesis in TC cells. Dendritic T-current may also have significant functional consequences, such as an efficient modulation of thalamic burst discharges by corticothalamic feedback.},

  abstract = {Thalamic reticular (RE) neurons are involved in the genesis of synchronized thalamocortical oscillations, which depend in part on their complex bursting properties. We have investigated the intrinsic properties of RE cells using computational models based on morphological and electrophysiological data. Simulations of a reconstructed RE cells were compared directly with recordings from the same cell to obtain precise values for the passive parameters. In a first series of experiments, the low-threshold calcium current (I(Ts)) was studied via voltage clamp in acutely dissociated RE cells that lack most of their dendrites. Simulations based on a cell with truncated dendrites and Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics reproduced these recordings with a relatively low density of I(Ts). In a second series of experiments, voltage-clamp recordings obtained in intact RE cells in slices showed a higher amplitude and slower kinetics of I(Ts). These properties could be reproduced from the reconstructed cell model assuming higher densities of I(Ts) in distal dendrites. In a third series of experiments, current-clamp recordings were obtained on RE cells in vivo. The marked differences with in vitro recordings could be reconciled by simulating synaptic bombardment in the dendrites of RE cells, but only if they contained high distal densities of I(Ts). In addition, simpler models with as few as three compartments could reproduce the same behavior assuming dendritic I(Ts). These models and experiments show how intrinsic bursting properties of RE cells, as recorded in vivo and in vitro, may be explained by dendritic calcium currents.},

The resting level value of [Ca2+]i in single Drosophila melanogaster larval salivary gland cells was 198 +/- 31 nM (n = 4). It increased approximately 10-fold, to 1,870 +/- 770 nM (n = 4), during a heat shock. When salivary glands were incubated in calcium-free, ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA)-buffered medium, the resting level value of [Ca2+]i was reduced to 80 +/- 7 nM (n = 3), and heat shock resulted in a fourfold increase in [Ca2+]i to 353 +/- 90 nM (n = 3). The intracellular free-ion concentrations of Na+, K+, Cl-, and Mg2+ were 9.6 +/- 0.8, 101.9 +/- 1.7, 36 +/- 1.5, and 2.4 +/- 0.2 mM, respectively, and remained essentially unchanged during a heat shock. Procedures were devised to mimic or block the effects of heat shock on pHi and [Ca2+]i and to assess their role in the induction of heat shock proteins. We report here that the changes in [Ca2+]i and pHi which occur during heat shock are not sufficient, nor are they required, for a complete induction of the heat shock response.},

  abstract = {The advantages of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, including low genetic redundancy, functional simplicity, and the ability to conduct large-scale genetic screens, have been essential for understanding the molecular nature of circadian ({$\sim$}24~hr) rhythms, and continue to be valuable in discovering novel regulators of circadian rhythms and sleep. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of these interrelated biological processes in Drosophila and the wider implications of this research. Clock genes period and timeless were first discovered in large-scale Drosophila genetic screens developed in the 1970s. Feedback of period and timeless on their own transcription forms the core of the molecular clock, and accurately timed expression, localization, post-transcriptional modification, and function of these genes is thought to be critical for maintaining the circadian cycle. Regulators, including several phosphatases and kinases, act on different steps of this feedback loop to ensure strong and accurately timed rhythms. Approximately 150 neurons in the fly brain that contain the core components of the molecular clock act together to translate this intracellular cycling into rhythmic behavior. We discuss how different groups of clock neurons serve different functions in allowing clocks to entrain to environmental cues, driving behavioral outputs at different times of day, and allowing flexible behavioral responses in different environmental conditions. The neuropeptide PDF provides an important signal thought to synchronize clock neurons, although the details of how PDF accomplishes this function are still being explored. Secreted signals from clock neurons also influence rhythms in other tissues. SLEEP is, in part, regulated by the circadian clock, which ensures appropriate timing of sleep, but the amount and quality of sleep are also determined by other mechanisms that ensure a homeostatic balance between sleep and wake. Flies have been useful for identifying a large set of genes, molecules, and neuroanatomic loci important for regulating sleep amount. Conserved aspects of sleep regulation in flies and mammals include wake-promoting roles for catecholamine neurotransmitters and involvement of hypothalamus-like regions, although other neuroanatomic regions implicated in sleep in flies have less clear parallels. Sleep is also subject to regulation by factors such as food availability, stress, and social environment. We are beginning to understand how the identified molecules and neurons interact with each other, and with the environment, to regulate sleep. Drosophila researchers can also take advantage of increasing mechanistic understanding of other behaviors, such as learning and memory, courtship, and aggression, to understand how sleep loss impacts these behaviors. Flies thus remain a valuable tool for both discovery of novel molecules and deep mechanistic understanding of sleep and circadian rhythms.},

  abstract = {Circadian rhythms have been extensively studied in               Drosophila               ; however, still little is known about how the electrical properties of clock neurons are specified. We have performed a behavioral genetic screen through the downregulation of candidate ion channels in the lateral ventral neurons (LNvs) and show that the hyperpolarization-activated cation current I               h               is important for the behaviors that the LNvs influence: temporal organization of locomotor activity, analyzed in males, and sleep, analyzed in females. Using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology we demonstrate that small LNvs (sLNvs) are bursting neurons, and that I               h               is necessary to achieve the high-frequency bursting firing pattern characteristic of both types of LNvs in females. Since firing in bursts has been associated to neuropeptide release, we hypothesized that I               h               would be important for LNvs communication. Indeed, herein we demonstrate that I               h               is fundamental for the recruitment of pigment dispersing factor (PDF) filled dense core vesicles (DCVs) to the terminals at the dorsal protocerebrum and for their timed release, and hence for the temporal coordination of circadian behaviors.                                         SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT               Ion channels are transmembrane proteins with selective permeability to specific charged particles. The rich repertoire of parameters that may gate their opening state, such as voltage-sensitivity, modulation by second messengers and specific kinetics, make this protein family a determinant of neuronal identity. Ion channel structure is evolutionary conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates, making any discovery easily translatable. Through a screen to uncover ion channels with roles in circadian rhythms, we have identified the I               h               channel as an important player in a subset of clock neurons of the fruit fly. We show that lateral ventral neurons (LNvs) need I               h               to fire action potentials in a high-frequency bursting mode and that this is important for peptide transport and the control of behavior.},

  abstract = {1. The properties of the Ca channel in tissue cultured clonal cells (GH               3               ) isolated from a rat anterior pituitary tumour were studied with the patch electrode voltage-clamp technique.                                         2. To isolate the current through the Ca channel, the currents through the Na channel, the delayed K channel and the Ca               2+               induced K channel were minimized by replacing the external Na               +               with TEA               +               and adding EGTA to the K-free solution inside the patch electrode.                                         3. The selectivity ratios through the Ca channel with different cations were 2{$\cdot$}7 (Ba               2+               ):1{$\cdot$}6 (Sr               2+               ):1{$\cdot$}0 (Ca               2+               ) and the               m               2               form of the activation kinetics and the relationships between the time constant and the membrane potential were common to the three divalent cations.                                         4. The amplitude of the Ba               2+               current increased linearly with [Ba               2+               ]               o               up to 25 mM and thereafter tended to show saturation.                                         5. The current---voltage relation showed a positive shift along the voltage axis as [Ba               2+               ]               o               increased, probably due to the screening effect of Ba               2+               on the negative surface charges.                                         6. The time constant of activation as a function of the membrane potential showed a parallel shift as [Ba               2+               ]               o               was increased, suggesting that the activation kinetics were independent of the permeant ion concentration.                                         7. The time constant of the tail current was consistent with               m               2               kinetics for opening and closing of the Ca channel.                          8. The extrapolated `instantaneous' tail current rapidly increased as the activating membrane potential became more positive and reached an apparent saturation at membrane potentials substantially more positive than the potential that gave the maximum peak inward current, and suggested that the single channel has a sigmoidal current---voltage relationship.                            9. The power density spectrum obtained during the steady-state inward Ba               2+               current had a cut-off frequency which was nearly voltage independent; this is expected if the fluctuation of the current originates from               m               2               activation kinetics.                                         10. The results of noise analysis suggest that the amplitude of the single Ca channel current was about 0{$\cdot$}2 pA at 25 mM-Ba               2+               and 0{$\cdot$}7 pA at 100 mM-Ba               2+               for membrane potentials in the vicinity of the maximum inward current.},

  abstract = {The inhibitory GABAergic projection of thalamic nucleus reticularis (nRt) neurons onto thalamocortical relay cells (TCs) is important in generating the normal thalamocortical rhythmicity of slow wave sleep, and may be a key element in the production of abnormal rhythms associated with absence epilepsy. Both TCs and nRt cells can generate prominent Ca(2+)-dependent low-threshold spikes, which evoke bursts of Na(+)-dependent fast spikes, and are influential in rhythm generation. Substantial differences in the pattern of burst firing in TCs versus nRt neurons led us to hypothesize that there are distinct forms of transient Ca2+ current (I(T)) underlying burst discharges in these two cell types. Using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, we analyzed I(T) in acutely isolated TCs and nRt neurons and found three key differences in biophysical properties. (1) The transient Ca2+ current in nRt neurons inactivated much more slowly than I(T) in TCs. This slow current is thus termed I(Ts). (2) The rate of inactivation for I(Ts) was nearly voltage independent. (3) Whole-cell I(Ts) amplitude was increased when Ba2+ was substituted for Ca2+ as the charge carrier. In addition, activation kinetics were slower for I(Ts) and the activation range was depolarized compared to that for I(T). Other properties of I(Ts) and I(T) were similar, including steady-state inactivation and sensitivities to blockade by divalent cations, amiloride, and antiepileptic drugs. Our findings demonstrate that subtypes of transient Ca2+ current are present in two different classes of thalamic neurons. The properties of I(Ts) lead to generation of long-duration calcium-dependent spike bursts in nRt cells. The resultant prolonged periods of GABA release onto TCs would play a critical role in maintaining rhythmicity by inducing TC hyperpolarization and promoting generation of low-threshold calcium spikes within relay nuclei.},

  abstract = {1. To perform simulations of the various modes of action potential generation in thalamic relay neurons, we developed Hodgkin-and-Huxley style mathematical equations that describe the voltage dependence and kinetics of activation and inactivation of four different currents, including the transient, low-voltage-activated Ca2+ current (IT), the rapidly inactivating transient K+ current (IA), the slowly inactivating K+ current (IK2), and the hyperpolarization-activated, mixed cationic current (Ih). The modeled currents were derived either from acutely dissociated rat thalamic relay neurons (IT, IA, IK2), or from guinea pig thalamic relay cells maintained in slices in vitro (Ih). 2. The voltage dependence of steady-state activation and inactivation of IT, IA, and IK2 and the activation of Ih could be modeled with Boltzmann-style equations. Modeling of the behavior of IT to depolarizing steps in voltage clamp required the use of the constant field equation to relate permeability to T-current amplitude. The time constant of activation of IT was described by a continuous bell-shaped function with a maximum near 15 ms at threshold for activation (-75 mV) and 23 degrees C. Mathematical description of the kinetics of inactivation and removal of inactivation of this current required two separate functions. 3. The rapidly activating and inactivating K+ current IA was modeled by assuming two components with different time constants of inactivation. The kinetics of activation was described as a continuous function of voltage with the slowest time constant, near 2.5 ms, at threshold for activation (-60 mV) and 23 degrees C. In contrast, the kinetics of inactivation of both components were described as voltage independent, consistent with experimental data. The rate or removal of inactivation of both components of IA was described as continuously increasing with the degree of hyperpolarization. 4. The slowly inactivating K+ current IK2 was also modeled by assuming two components with different rates of inactivation. The kinetics of activation were described by a bell-shaped function with a maximum time constant near 80 ms at -40 mV and 23 degrees C, whereas threshold for activation was approximately -60 mV. Inactivation of both components was modeled as relatively independent of voltage, whereas removal of inactivation was described as a continuous function of membrane potential. 5. The hyperpolarization-activation cationic current, Ih, was modeled by assuming that the current activates with a single exponential relation and does not inactivate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {A typical neuron signals to downstream cells when it is depolarized and firing sodium spikes. Some neurons, however, also fire calcium spikes when hyperpolarized. The function of such bidirectional signaling remains unclear in most circuits. Here we show how a neuron class that participates in vector computation in the fly central complex employs hyperpolarization-elicited calcium spikes to invert two-dimensional mathematical vectors. When cells switch from firing sodium to calcium spikes, this leads to a \textasciitilde 180{$^\circ$} realignment between the vector encoded in the neuronal population and the fly's internal heading signal, thus inverting the vector. We show that the calcium spikes rely on the T-type calcium channel Ca-{$\alpha$}1T, and argue, via analytical and experimental approaches, that these spikes enable vector computations in portions of angular space that would otherwise be inaccessible. These results reveal a seamless interaction between molecular, cellular and circuit properties for implementing vector math in the brain.},

  abstract = {Explains the relationship of electrophysiology, nonlinear dynamics, and the computational properties of neurons, with each concept presented in terms of both neuroscience and mathematics and illustrated using geometrical intuition.             In order to model neuronal behavior or to interpret the results of modeling studies, neuroscientists must call upon methods of nonlinear dynamics. This book offers an introduction to nonlinear dynamical systems theory for researchers and graduate students in neuroscience. It also provides an overview of neuroscience for mathematicians who want to learn the basic facts of electrophysiology.             Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience presents a systematic study of the relationship of electrophysiology, nonlinear dynamics, and computational properties of neurons. It emphasizes that information processing in the brain depends not only on the electrophysiological properties of neurons but also on their dynamical properties. The book introduces dynamical systems, starting with one- and two-dimensional Hodgkin-Huxley-type models and continuing to a description of bursting systems. Each chapter proceeds from the simple to the complex, and provides sample problems at the end. The book explains all necessary mathematical concepts using geometrical intuition; it includes many figures and few equations, making it especially suitable for non-mathematicians. Each concept is presented in terms of both neuroscience and mathematics, providing a link between the two disciplines.             Nonlinear dynamical systems theory is at the core of computational neuroscience research, but it is not a standard part of the graduate neuroscience curriculum---or taught by math or physics department in a way that is suitable for students of biology. This book offers neuroscience students and researchers a comprehensive account of concepts and methods increasingly used in computational neuroscience.

  abstract = {Mammalian T-type Ca(2+) channels are encoded by three separate genes (Cav3.1, 3.2, 3.3). These channels are reported to be sleep stabilizers important in the generation of the delta rhythms of deep sleep, but controversy remains. The identification of precise physiological functions for the T-type channels has been hindered, at least in part, by the potential for compensation between the products of these three genes and a lack of specific pharmacological inhibitors. Invertebrates have only one T-type channel gene, but its functions are even less well-studied. We cloned Ca-{$\alpha$}1T, the only Cav3 channel gene in Drosophila melanogaster, expressed it in Xenopus oocytes and HEK-293 cells, and confirmed it passes typical T-type currents. Voltage-clamp analysis revealed the biophysical properties of Ca-{$\alpha$}1T show mixed similarity, sometimes falling closer to Cav3.1, sometimes to Cav3.2, and sometimes to Cav3.3. We found Ca-{$\alpha$}1T is broadly expressed across the adult fly brain in a pattern vaguely reminiscent of mammalian T-type channels. In addition, flies lacking Ca-{$\alpha$}1T show an abnormal increase in sleep duration most pronounced during subjective day under continuous dark conditions despite normal oscillations of the circadian clock. Thus, our study suggests invertebrate T-type Ca(2+) channels promote wakefulness rather than stabilizing sleep.},

  abstract = {We examined the concentration dependence of currents through CaV3.1 T-type calcium channels, varying Ca2+ and Ba2+ over a wide concentration range (100 nM to 110 mM) while recording whole-cell currents over a wide voltage range from channels stably expressed in HEK 293 cells. To isolate effects on permeation, instantaneous current--voltage relationships (IIV) were obtained following strong, brief depolarizations to activate channels with minimal inactivation. Reversal potentials were described by PCa/PNa = 87 and PCa/PBa = 2, based on Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz theory. However, analysis of chord conductances found that apparent Kd values were similar for Ca2+ and Ba2+, both for block of currents carried by Na+ (3 {$\mu$}M for Ca2+ vs. 4 {$\mu$}M for Ba2+, at -30 mV; weaker at more positive or negative voltages) and for permeation (3.3 mM for Ca2+ vs. 2.5 mM for Ba2+; nearly voltage independent). Block by 3--10 {$\mu$}M Ca2+ was time dependent, described by bimolecular kinetics with binding at {$\sim$}3 \texttimes{} 108 M-1s-1 and voltage-dependent exit. Ca2+o, Ba2+o, and Mg2+o also affected channel gating, primarily by shifting channel activation, consistent with screening a surface charge of 1 e- per 98 \AA 2 from Gouy-Chapman theory. Additionally, inward currents inactivated {$\sim$}35\% faster in Ba2+o (vs. Ca2+o or Na+o). The accelerated inactivation in Ba2+o correlated with the transition from Na+ to Ba2+ permeation, suggesting that Ba2+o speeds inactivation by occupying the pore. We conclude that the selectivity of the ``surface charge'' among divalent cations differs between calcium channel families, implying that the surface charge is channel specific. Voltage strongly affects the concentration dependence of block, but not of permeation, for Ca2+ or Ba2+.},

  abstract = {Activity of voltage-gated Na channels (Na               v               ) is modified by alternative splicing. However, whether altered splicing of human Na               v               s contributes to epilepsy remains to be conclusively shown. We show here that altered splicing of the               Drosophila               Na               v               (               paralytic               ,                                DmNa                 v                              ) contributes to seizure-like behavior in identified seizure mutants. We focus attention on a pair of mutually exclusive alternate exons (termed               K               and               L               ), which form part of the voltage sensor (S4) in domain III of the expressed channel. The presence of exon               L               results in a large, non-inactivating, persistent               I               Nap               . Many forms of human epilepsy are associated with an increase in this current. In wild-type (WT)               Drosophila               larvae, {$\sim$}70--80\% of                                DmNa                 v                              transcripts contain exon               L               , and the remainder contain exon               K               . Splicing of                                DmNa                 v                              to include exon               L               is increased to {$\sim$}100\% in both the               slamdance               and               easily-shocked               seizure mutants. This change to splicing is prevented by reducing synaptic activity levels through exposure to the antiepileptic phenytoin or the inhibitory transmitter GABA. Conversely, enhancing synaptic activity in WT, by feeding of picrotoxin is sufficient to increase               I               Nap               and promote seizure through increased inclusion of exon               L               to 100\%. We also show that the underlying activity-dependent mechanism requires the presence of Pasilla, an RNA-binding protein. Finally, we use computational modeling to show that increasing               I               Nap               is sufficient to potentiate membrane excitability consistent with a seizure phenotype. Thus, increased synaptic excitation favors inclusion of exon               L               , which, in turn, further increases neuronal excitability. Thus, at least in               Drosophila               , this self-reinforcing cycle may promote the incidence of seizure.},

  abstract = {Diversity in neuronal signaling is a product not only of differential gene expression, but also of alternative splicing. However, although recognized, the precise contribution of alternative splicing in ion channel transcripts to channel kinetics remains poorly understood. Invertebrates, with their smaller genomes, offer attractive models to examine the contribution of splicing to neuronal function. In this study we report the sequencing and biophysical characterization of alternative splice variants of the sole voltage-gated Na               +               gene ( DmNa               v               , paralytic), in late-stage embryos of Drosophila melanogaster. We identify 27 unique splice variants, based on the presence of 15 alternative exons. Heterologous expression, in Xenopus oocytes, shows that alternative exons j, e, and f primarily influence activation kinetics: when present, exon f confers a hyperpolarizing shift in half-activation voltage ( V               1/2               ), whereas j and e result in a depolarizing shift. The presence of exon h is sufficient to produce a depolarizing shift in the V               1/2               of steady-state inactivation. The magnitude of the persistent Na               +               current, but not the fast-inactivating current, in both oocytes and Drosophila motoneurons in vivo is directly influenced by the presence of either one of a pair of mutually exclusive, membrane-spanning exons, termed k and L. Transcripts containing k have significantly smaller persistent currents compared with those containing L. Finally, we show that transcripts lacking all cytoplasmic alternatively spliced exons still produce functional channels, indicating that splicing may influence channel kinetics not only through change to protein structure, but also by allowing differential modification (i.e., phosphorylation, binding of cofactors, etc.). Our results provide a functional basis for understanding how alternative splicing of a voltage-gated Na               +               channel results in diversity in neuronal signaling.},

We introduce a reliable assay for intracellular calcium dynamics in Drosophila larval motor neuron terminals, and a new physiological solution that improves the longevity of the larval preparation. By loading calcium indicators into motor neuron terminals through cut axons, we obtained a high signal-to-noise ratio with confocal microscopy, and good temporal resolution of calcium-dependent fluorescence changes. We provide an estimate for the resting intracellular calcium concentration, the first description of calcium kinetics for a single action potential (AP), and improved resolution of calcium kinetics during AP trains. The very rapid decay of the calcium signal following a single AP ({$\tau$}\,{$\sim$}60 ms) indicates a previously unreported fast calcium extrusion mechanism in Drosophila motor neuron terminals well suited for sustaining physiological processes during the high rates of impulse activity which drive locomotor activity.},

  abstract = {1. A model of the electrophysiological properties of single thalamocortical relay neurons in the rodent and cat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus was constructed, based in part on the voltage dependence and kinetics of ionic currents detailed with voltage-clamp techniques. The model made the simplifying assumption of a single uniform compartment and incorporated a fast and transient Na+ current, INa; a persistent, depolarization-activated Na+ current, INap; a low-threshold Ca2+ current, I(T); a high-threshold Ca2+ current, IL; a Ca(2+)-activated K+ current, IC; a transient and depolarization-activated K+ current, IA; a slowly inactivating and depolarization-activated K+ current, IK2; a hyperpolarization-activated cation current, Ih; and K+ and Na+ leak currents IKleak and INaleak. 2. The effects of the various ionic currents on the electrophysiological properties of thalamocortical relay neurons were initially investigated through examining the effect of each current individually on passive membrane responses. The two leak currents, IKleak and INaleak, determined in large part the resting membrane potential and the apparent input resistance of the model neuron. Addition of IA resulted in a delay in the response of the model cell to a depolarizing current pulse, whereas addition of IK2, or IL combined with IC, resulted in a marked and prolonged decrease in the response to depolarization. Addition of Ih resulted in a depolarizing "sag" in response to hyperpolarization, whereas addition of IT resulted in a large rebound Ca2+ spike after hyperpolarization. Finally, addition of INap resulted in enhancement of depolarization. 3. The low-threshold Ca2+ spike of rodent neurons was successfully modeled with the active currents I(T), IL, IA, IC, and IK2. The low-threshold Ca2+ current I(T) generated the low-threshold Ca2+ spike. The transient K+ current IA slowed the rate of rise and reduced the peak amplitude of the low-threshold Ca2+ spike, whereas the slowly inactivating K+ current IK2 contributed greatly to the repolarization of the Ca2+ spike. Activation of IL during the peak of the Ca2+ spike led to activation of IC, which also contributed to the repolarization of the Ca2+ spike. Reduction of any one of the K+ currents resulted in an increase in the other two, thereby resulting in substantially smaller changes in the Ca2+ spike than would be expected on the basis of the amplitude of each ionic current alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Sodium currents were expressed in approximately 65\% of the neurons prepared from wild-type Drosophila embryos when examined at room temperature, 24 hr after plating. While current density was low, other features of the sodium current in wild-type neurons, including the voltage sensitivity, steady- state inactivation, macroscopic time course, and TTX sensitivity were similar to those found in other excitable cells. Physiological and biochemical evidence has led to the suggestion that mutations in the nap, seizure, and tip-E loci of Drosophila may affect voltage-dependent sodium channels. There was no significant difference in the percentage of neurons expressing sodium currents in cultures prepared from embryos with mutations at the nap, sei or tip-E loci compared with wild-type cultures. Sodium currents recorded from napts appeared similar in all of the properties examined to those in wild-type cells. However, neuronal sodium current density was 40--60\% lower in cultures prepared from both tip-E and seits1 embryos. The voltage dependence and gating properties of these sodium channels, as well as the TTX sensitivity, appear similar to wild type. These results indicate that both the tip-E and sei loci are important in regulation of sodium current density in embryonic neurons.},

  abstract = {Significance             A deep puzzle in neuroscience is how neurons maintain their electrical properties despite continuous ion channel turnover and activity perturbations. Previous work proposed that activity-dependent homeostatic rules ensure robust development of excitability by regulating channel density, although it is not understood how these rules shape the distribution of ion channel types nor how finely tuned these rules must be. We show that generic homeostatic regulation rules impose correlations in the steady-state distribution of ion channels, as has been recently observed experimentally. Specific correlations depend on relative expression rates, and the regulation rules themselves are far more robust than previously thought.           ,              Experimental observations reveal that the expression levels of different ion channels vary across neurons of a defined type, even when these neurons exhibit stereotyped electrical properties. However, there are robust correlations between different ion channel expression levels, although the mechanisms that determine these correlations are unknown. Using generic model neurons, we show that correlated conductance expression can emerge from simple homeostatic control mechanisms that couple expression rates of individual conductances to cellular readouts of activity. The correlations depend on the relative rates of expression of different conductances. Thus, variability is consistent with homeostatic regulation and the structure of this variability reveals quantitative relations between regulation dynamics of different conductances. Furthermore, we show that homeostatic regulation is remarkably insensitive to the details that couple the regulation of a given conductance to overall neuronal activity because of degeneracy in the function of multiple conductances and can be robust to ``antihomeostatic'' regulation of a subset of conductances expressed in a cell.},

  abstract = {In multipolar vertebrate neurons, action potentials (APs) initiate close to the soma, at the axonal initial segment. Invertebrate neurons are typically unipolar with dendrites integrating directly into the axon. Where APs are initiated in the axons of invertebrate neurons is unclear. Voltage-gated sodium (Na               V               ) channels are a functional hallmark of the axonal initial segment in vertebrates. We used an intronic               Minos               -Mediated Integration Cassette to determine the endogenous gene expression and subcellular localization of the sole Na               V               channel in both male and female               Drosophila               ,               para               . Despite being the only Na               V               channel in the fly, we show that only 23 \textpm{} 1\% of neurons in the embryonic and larval CNS express               para               , while in the adult CNS               para               is broadly expressed. We generated a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the whole third instar larval brain to identify               para               expressing neurons and show that it positively correlates with markers of differentiated, actively firing neurons. Therefore, only 23 \textpm{} 1\% of larval neurons may be capable of firing Na               V               -dependent APs. We then show that Para is enriched in an axonal segment, distal to the site of dendritic integration into the axon, which we named the distal axonal segment (DAS). The DAS is present in multiple neuron classes in both the third instar larval and adult CNS. Whole cell patch clamp electrophysiological recordings of adult CNS fly neurons are consistent with the interpretation that Na               v               -dependent APs originate in the DAS. Identification of the distal Na               V               localization in fly neurons will enable more accurate interpretation of electrophysiological recordings in invertebrates.                                         SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT               The site of action potential (AP) initiation in invertebrates is unknown. We tagged the sole voltage-gated sodium (Na               V               ) channel in the fly,               para               , and identified that Para is enriched at a distal axonal segment. The distal axonal segment is located distal to where dendrites impinge on axons and is the likely site of AP initiation. Understanding where APs are initiated improves our ability to model neuronal activity and our interpretation of electrophysiological data. Additionally,               para               is only expressed in 23 \textpm{} 1\% of third instar larval neurons but is broadly expressed in adults. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the third instar larval brain shows that               para               expression correlates with the expression of active, differentiated neuronal markers. Therefore, only 23 \textpm{} 1\% of third instar larval neurons may be able to actively fire Na               V               -dependent APs.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The neural mechanisms that balance waking and sleep to ensure adequate sleep quality in mammals are highly complex, often eluding functional insight. In the last two decades, researchers made impressive progress in studying the less complex brain of the invertebrate model organism               Drosophila melanogaster               , which has led to a deeper understanding of the neural principles of sleep regulation. Here, we will review these findings to illustrate that neural networks require sleep to undergo synaptic reorganization that allows for the incorporation of experiences made during the waking hours. Sleep need, therefore, can arise as a consequence of sensory processing, often signalized by neural networks as they synchronize their electrical patterns to generate slow-wave activity. The slow-wave activity provides the neurophysiological basis to establish a sensory gate that suppresses sensory processing to provide a resting phase which promotes synaptic rescaling and clearance of metabolites from the brain. Moreover, we demonstrate how neural networks for homeostatic and circadian sleep regulation interact to consolidate sleep into a specific daily period. We particularly highlight that the basic functions and physiological principles of sleep are highly conserved throughout the phylogenetic spectrum, allowing us to identify the functional components and neural interactions that construct the neural architecture of sleep regulation.},

This state transition results from deinactivation of a regenerative depolarizing event referred to as the low-threshold spike. Isolated adult guinea pig thalamic (dorsal lateral geniculate) neurons exhibited low-threshold spikes that could be blocked by low concentrations of nickel but were unaffected by the dihydropyridine nimodipine. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from these cells demonstrated a low-threshold, rapidly inactivating (T) Ca2+ current that manifested similar voltage dependency and time course as the low-threshold spike. Like low-threshold spikes, the T-type Ca2+ current was eliminated by nickel but was unaffected by nimodipine. In thalamic neurons, T-type Ca2+ channels underlie the low-threshold spike and, therefore, play a critical role in regulating the firing pattern of these cells.},

  abstract = {Since Ca2+ is a major competitor of protons for the modulation of high voltage--activated Ca2+ channels, we have studied the modulation by extracellular Ca2+ of the effects of proton on the T-type Ca2+ channel {$\alpha$}1G (CaV3.1) expressed in HEK293 cells. At 2 mM extracellular Ca2+ concentration, extracellular acidification in the pH range from 9.1 to 6.2 induced a positive shift of the activation curve and increased its slope factor. Both effects were significantly reduced if the concentration was increased to 20 mM or enhanced in the absence of Ca2+. Extracellular protons shifted the voltage dependence of the time constant of activation and decreased its voltage sensitivity, which excludes a voltage-dependent open pore block by protons as the mechanism modifying the activation curve. Changes in the extracellular pH altered the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation and deactivation kinetics in a Ca2+-dependent manner, but these effects were not strictly correlated with those on activation. Model simulations suggest that protons interact with intermediate closed states in the activation pathway, decreasing the gating charge and shifting the equilibrium between these states to less negative potentials, with these effects being inhibited by extracellular Ca2+. Extracellular acidification also induced an open pore block and a shift in selectivity toward monovalent cations, which were both modulated by extracellular Ca2+ and Na+. Mutation of the EEDD pore locus altered the Ca2+-dependent proton effects on channel selectivity and permeation. We conclude that Ca2+ modulates T-type channel function by competing with protons for binding to surface charges, by counteracting a proton-induced modification of channel activation and by competing with protons for binding to the selectivity filter of the channel.},

In each case, different stable activity patterns can coexist over a substantial parameter range.},

  abstract = {1. A model of the transient, low-threshold voltage-dependent (T-type) Ca2+ current is constructed using recent whole-cell voltage-clamp data from enzymatically isolated rat thalamocortical relay neurons. The T-type Ca2+ current is described according to the Hodgkin-Huxley scheme, using the m3h format, with rate constants determined from the experimental data (22-24 degrees C; extracellular Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]o = 3 mM). 2. The T-type Ca2+ current inactivates rapidly during maintained depolarization (time constant, Tau h approximately 20 ms at -20 mV), yet recovery from inactivation is slow (time constant, Tau r approximately 270 ms at -80 mV). To reconcile these observations, a two-step kinetic scheme is proposed for the inactivation gate. Each of the time constants in this scheme is voltage dependent, with a maximum at about -85 mV (45 ms for one and 275 ms for the other). 3. Numerical simulations of recovery in a two-pulse, voltage-clamp protocol compare favorably with experimental results obtained by Coulter et al. as well as those obtained in an independent series of experiments with guinea pig thalamic neurons ([Ca2+]o = 10 mM). 4. For current-clamp simulations, a leakage current gL (V-VL) is included; with VL = -65 mV, the calculated resting membrane potential is -63 mV. 5. It is shown that the T-type Ca2+ current together with the leakage current suffices to describe the low-threshold spike (LTS), a slow, triangular-shaped depolarizing event that can be evoked only from relatively hyperpolarized membrane potentials and that underlies the burst firing of Na(+)-dependent action potentials in thalamic neurons. Outward currents are not required to reproduce the basic shape of the LTS. 6. The LTS can be activated with either a depolarizing current step from a sufficiently hyperpolarized level or on termination of a hyperpolarizing current step. In either case, the amplitude of the LTS is a monotonically increasing, sigmoid-shape function of the hyperpolarizing current step intensity. 7. Because of the slower kinetic step of the channel's inactivation gate, our model predicts that recovery of the LTS to greater than one-half amplitude would require a prolonged hyperpolarization of greater than 100 ms (at body temperature). This imposes an upper limit (approximately 10 Hz) on the frequency of repetitive hyperpolarization that can elicit a train of LTSs and hence on the frequency of any rhythm that requires LTS-mediated bursting of thalamic neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Coexpression of tipE with para results in elevated levels of sodium currents and accelerated current decay. Para/TipE sodium channels have biophysical and pharmacological properties similar to those of native channels. However, the pharmacology of these channels differs from that of vertebrate sodium channels: (a) toxin II from Anemonia sulcata, which slows inactivation, binds to Para and some mammalian sodium channels with similar affinity (Kd {$\cong$} 10 nM), but this toxin causes a 100-fold greater decrease in the rate of inactivation of Para/TipE than of mammalian channels; (b) Para sodium channels are \&gt;10-fold more sensitive to block by tetrodotoxin; and (c) modification by the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin is \&gt;100-fold more potent for Para than for rat brain type IIA sodium channels. Our results suggest that the selective toxicity of pyrethroid insecticides is due at least in part to the greater affinity of pyrethroids for insect sodium channels than for mammalian sodium channels.},
