  abstract = {Conductance-based models of neural activity produce large amounts of data that can be hard to visualize and interpret. We introduce visualization methods to display the dynamics of the ionic currents and to display the models' response to perturbations. To visualize the currents' dynamics, we compute the percent contribution of each current and display them over time using stacked-area plots. The waveform of the membrane potential and the contribution of each current change as the models are perturbed. To represent these changes over a range of the perturbation control parameter, we compute and display the distributions of these waveforms. We illustrate these procedures in six examples of bursting model neurons with similar activity but that differ as much as threefold in their conductance densities. These visualization methods provide heuristic insight into why individual neurons or networks with similar behavior can respond widely differently to perturbations.},

  abstract = {The signaling properties of thalamocortical (TC) neurons depend on the diversity of ion conductance mechanisms that underlie their rich membrane behavior at subthreshold potentials. Using patch-clamp recordings of TC neurons in brain slices from mice and a realistic conductance-based computational model, we characterized seven subthreshold ion currents of TC neurons and quantified their individual contributions to the total steady-state conductance at levels below tonic firing threshold. We then used the TC neuron model to show that the resting membrane potential results from the interplay of several inward and outward currents over a background provided by the potassium and sodium leak currents. The steady-state conductances of depolarizing I               h               (hyperpolarization-activated cationic current), I               T               (low-threshold calcium current), and I               NaP               (persistent sodium current) move the membrane potential away from the reversal potential of the leak conductances. This depolarization is counteracted in turn by the hyperpolarizing steady-state current of I               A               (fast transient A-type potassium current) and I               Kir               (inwardly rectifying potassium current). Using the computational model, we have shown that single parameter variations compatible with physiological or pathological modulation promote burst firing periodicity. The balance between three amplifying variables (activation of I               T               , activation of I               NaP               , and activation of I               Kir               ) and three recovering variables (inactivation of I               T               , activation of I               A               , and activation of I               h               ) determines the propensity, or lack thereof, of repetitive burst firing of TC neurons. We also have determined the specific roles that each of these variables have during the intrinsic oscillation.},

These effects depend on discrete morning and evening clock neurons, independent of their roles in circadian locomotor activity. In the R5 ellipsoid body sleep homeostat, we identified elevated morning expression of activity dependent and presynaptic gene expression as well as the presynaptic protein BRUCHPILOT consistent with regulation by clock circuits. These neurons also display elevated calcium levels in response to sleep loss in the morning, but not the evening consistent with the observed time-dependent sleep rebound. These studies reveal the circuit and molecular mechanisms by which discrete circadian clock neurons program a homeostatic sleep center.},

They are encoded by the               KCNH               gene family and divided into three subfamilies, eag (Kv10), erg (eag-related gene; Kv11) and elk (eag-like; Kv12). All EAG channel subtypes are expressed in the brain where they effectively modulate neuronal excitability. This Topical Review describes the biophysical properties of each of the EAG channel subtypes, their function in neurons and the neurological diseases induced by EAG channel mutations. In contrast to the function of erg currents in the heart, where they contribute to repolarization of the cardiac action potential, erg currents in neurons are involved in the maintenance of the resting potential, setting of action potential threshold and frequency accommodation. They can even support high frequency firing by preventing a depolarization-induced Na               +               channel block. EAG channels are modulated differentially, e.g. eag channels by intracellular Ca               2+               , erg channels by extracellular K               +               and GPCRs, and elk channels by changes in pH. So far, only currents mediated by erg channels have been recorded in neurons with the help of selective blockers. Neuronal eag and elk currents have not been isolated due to the lack of suitable channel blockers. However, findings in KO mice indicate a physiological role of eag1 currents in synaptic transmission and an involvement of elk2 currents in cognitive performance. Human eag1 and eag2 gain-of-function mutations underlie syndromes associated with epileptic seizures.                                                   image},

  abstract = {Drosophila ether-\`a-go-go ( eag) is the founding member of a large family of voltage-gated K               +               channels, the KCNH family, which includes Kv10, 11, and 12. Concurrent binding of calcium/calmodulin (Ca               2+               /CaM) to NH               2               - and COOH-terminal sites inhibits mammalian EAG1 channels at submicromolar Ca               2+               concentrations, likely by causing pore constriction. Although the Drosophila EAG channel was believed to be Ca               2+               -insensitive (Sch\"onherr R, L\"ober K, Heinemann SH. EMBO J 19: 3263--3271, 2000.), both the NH2- and COOH-terminal sites are conserved. In this study we show that Drosophila EAG is inhibited by high Ca               2+               concentrations that are only present at plasma membrane Ca               2+               channel microdomains. To test the role of this regulation in vivo, we engineered mutations that block CaM-binding to the major COOH-terminal site of the endogenous eag locus, disrupting Ca               2+               -dependent inhibition. eag CaMBD mutants have reduced evoked release from larval motor neuron presynaptic terminals and show decreased Ca               2+               influx in stimulated adult projection neuron presynaptic terminals, consistent with an increase in K               +               conductance. These results are predicted by a conductance-based multicompartment model of the presynaptic terminal in which some fraction of EAG is localized to the Ca               2+               channel microdomains that control neurotransmitter release. The reduction of release in the larval neuromuscular junction drives a compensatory increase in motor neuron somatic excitability. This misregulation of synaptic and somatic excitability has consequences for systems-level processes and leads to defects in associative memory formation in adults.                                         NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Regulation of excitability is critical to tuning the nervous system for complex behaviors. We demonstrate in this article that the EAG family of voltage-gated K               +               channels exhibit conserved gating by Ca               2+               /CaM. Disruption of this inhibition in Drosophila results in decreased evoked neurotransmitter release due to truncated Ca               2+               influx in presynaptic terminals. In adults, disrupted Ca               2+               dynamics cripples memory formation. These data demonstrate that the biophysical details of channels have important implications for cell function and behavior.},

  abstract = {Deducing plausible reaction schemes from single-channel current traces is time-consuming and difficult. The goal is to find the simplest scheme that fits the data, but there are many ways to connect even a small number of states ({$>$}2 million schemes with four open and four closed states). Many schemes make identical predictions. An exhaustive search over model space does not address the many equivalent schemes that will result. We have found a canonical form that can express all reaction schemes for binary channels. This form has the minimal number of rate constants for any rank (number of independent open-closed transitions), unlike other canonical forms such as the well established ``uncoupled'' scheme. Because all of the interconductance transitions in the new form are independent, we refer to it as the manifest interconductance rank (MIR) form. In the case of four open and four closed states, there are four MIR form schemes, corresponding to ranks 1-4. For many models proposed in the literature for specific ion channels, the equivalent MIR form has dramatically fewer links than the uncoupled form. By using the MIR form we prove that all rank 1 topologies with a given number of open and closed states make identical predictions in steady state, thus narrowing the search space for simple models. Moreover, we prove that fitting to canonical form preserves detailed balance. We also propose an efficient hierarchical algorithm for searching for the simplest possible model consistent with a given data set.},

Asynchronous release contributes to information transfer at synapses, including at the hippocampal mossy fiber (MF) to CA3 pyramidal cell synapse where it controls the timing of postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal neuron firing. Here, we identified and characterized the main determinants of asynchronous release at the MF-CA3 synapse. We found that asynchronous release at MF-CA3 synapses can last on the order of seconds following repetitive MF stimulation. Elevating the stimulation frequency or the external Ca2+ concentration increased the rate of asynchronous release, thus, arguing that presynaptic Ca2+ dynamics is the major determinant of asynchronous release rate. Direct MF bouton Ca2+ imaging revealed slow Ca2+ decay kinetics of action potential (AP) burst-evoked Ca2+ transients. Finally, we observed that asynchronous release was preferentially mediated by Ca2+ influx through P/Q-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, while the contribution of N-type VGCCs was limited. Overall, our results uncover the determinants of long-lasting asynchronous release from MF terminals and suggest that asynchronous release could influence CA3 pyramidal cell firing up to seconds following termination of granule cell bursting.},

Calcium currents were recorded with whole-cell voltage-clamp procedures in relay neurones of the rat thalamus which had been acutely isolated by an enzymatic dissociation procedure. 2. Low-threshold and high-threshold Ca2+ currents were elicited by depolarizing voltage steps from holding potentials more negative than -60 mV. A transient current, analogous to the T-current in sensory neurones, was activated at low threshold near -65 mV and was completely inactivating at command steps up to -35 mV. Voltage steps to more depolarized levels activated a high-threshold current that inactivated slowly and incompletely during a 200 ms step depolarization. 3. The high-threshold current contained both non-inactivating and slowly inactivating components which were insensitive and sensitive to holding potential, respectively. 4. A 'T-type' current was prominent in relay neurones, in both absolute terms (350 pA peak current average) and in relation to high-threshold currents. The average ratio of maximum transient to maximum sustained current was greater than 2. 5. T-current could be modelled in a manner analogous to that employed for the fast Na+ current underlying action potential generation, using the m3h format. The rate of activation of T-current was voltage dependent, with a time constant (tau m) varying between 8 and 2 ms at command potentials of -60 to -10 mV at 23 degrees C. The rate of inactivation was also voltage dependent, and the time constant tau h varied between 50 and 20 ms over the same voltage range. With command potentials more positive than -35 mV, the inactivation of Ca2+ current could no longer be fitted by a single exponential. 6. Steady-state inactivation of T-current could be well fitted by a Boltzman equation with slope factor of 6.3 and half-inactivated voltage of -83.5 mV. 7. Recovery from inactivation of T-current was not exponential. The major component of recovery (70-80\% of total) was not very voltage sensitive at potentials more negative than -90 mV, with tau r of 251 ms at -92 mV and 23 degrees C, compared to 225 ms at -112 mV. A smaller, voltage-sensitive component accounted for the remainder of recovery. 8. All kinetic properties, including rates of activation, inactivation, and recovery from inactivation, as well as the amplitude of T-current, were temperature sensitive with Q10 (temperature coefficient) values of greater than 2.5.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

If the time course of rate constants can be approximated by a pulse, HH equations can be solved analytically. Pulse-based (PB) models generate action potentials very similar to the HH model but are computationally faster. Unlike the classical integrate-and fire (IAF) approach, they take into account the changes of conductances during and after the spike, which have a determinant influence in shaping neuronal responses. Similarities and differences among PB, IAF, and HH models are illustrated for three cases: high-frequency repetitive firing, spike timing following random synaptic inputs, and network behavior in the presence of intrinsic currents.},

  abstract = {The low-threshold calcium current (IT) underlies burst generation in thalamocortical (TC) relay cells and plays a central role in the genesis of synchronized oscillations by thalamic circuits. Here we have combined in vitro recordings and computational modeling techniques to investigate the consequences of dendritically located IT in TC cells. Simulations of a reconstructed TC cell were compared with the recordings obtained in the same cell to constrain the values of its passive parameters. T-current densities in soma and proximal dendrites were then estimated by matching the model to voltage-clamp recordings obtained in dissociated TC cells, which lack most of the dendrites. The distal dendritic T-current density was constrained by recordings in intact TC cells, which show 5-14 times larger peak T-current amplitudes compared with dissociated cells. Comparison of the model with the recordings of the same cell constrained further the T-current density in dendrites, which had to be 4.5-7.6 times higher than in the soma to reproduce all experimental results. Similar conclusions were reached using a simplified three-compartment model. Functionally, the model shows that the same amount of T-channels can lead to different bursting behaviors if they are exclusively somatic or distributed throughout the dendrites. In conclusion, this combination of models and experiments shows that dendritic T-currents are necessary to reproduce low-threshold calcium electrogenesis in TC cells. Dendritic T-current may also have significant functional consequences, such as an efficient modulation of thalamic burst discharges by corticothalamic feedback.},

  abstract = {Thalamic reticular (RE) neurons are involved in the genesis of synchronized thalamocortical oscillations, which depend in part on their complex bursting properties. We have investigated the intrinsic properties of RE cells using computational models based on morphological and electrophysiological data. Simulations of a reconstructed RE cells were compared directly with recordings from the same cell to obtain precise values for the passive parameters. In a first series of experiments, the low-threshold calcium current (I(Ts)) was studied via voltage clamp in acutely dissociated RE cells that lack most of their dendrites. Simulations based on a cell with truncated dendrites and Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics reproduced these recordings with a relatively low density of I(Ts). In a second series of experiments, voltage-clamp recordings obtained in intact RE cells in slices showed a higher amplitude and slower kinetics of I(Ts). These properties could be reproduced from the reconstructed cell model assuming higher densities of I(Ts) in distal dendrites. In a third series of experiments, current-clamp recordings were obtained on RE cells in vivo. The marked differences with in vitro recordings could be reconciled by simulating synaptic bombardment in the dendrites of RE cells, but only if they contained high distal densities of I(Ts). In addition, simpler models with as few as three compartments could reproduce the same behavior assuming dendritic I(Ts). These models and experiments show how intrinsic bursting properties of RE cells, as recorded in vivo and in vitro, may be explained by dendritic calcium currents.},

  abstract = {MATCONT is a graphical MATLAB software package for the interactive numerical study of dynamical systems. It allows one to compute curves of equilibria, limit points, Hopf points, limit cycles, period doubling bifurcation points of limit cycles, and fold bifurcation points of limit cycles. All curves are computed by the same function that implements a prediction-correction continuation algorithm based on the Moore-Penrose matrix pseudo-inverse. The continuation of bifurcation points of equilibria and limit cycles is based on bordering methods and minimally extended systems. Hence no additional unknowns such as singular vectors and eigenvectors are used and no artificial sparsity in the systems is created. The sparsity of the discretized systems for the computation of limit cycles and their bifurcation points is exploited by using the standard Matlab sparse matrix methods. The MATLAB environment makes the standard MATLAB Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) Suite interactively available and provides computational and visualization tools; it also eliminates the compilation stage and so makes installation straightforward. Compared to other packages such as AUTO and CONTENT, adding a new type of curves is easy in the MATLAB environment. We illustrate this by a detailed description of the limit point curve type.},

We show cell type-specific transcriptomic changes, with glia displaying the largest variation. Glia are also among the few cell types whose gene expression correlates with both sleep homeostat and circadian clock. The sleep--wake cycle and sleep drive level affect the expression of clock gene regulators in glia, and disrupting clock genes specifically in glia impairs homeostatic sleep rebound after sleep deprivation. These findings provide a comprehensive view of the effects of sleep homeostatic and circadian processes on distinct cell types in an entire animal brain and reveal glia as an interaction site of these two processes to determine sleep--wake dynamics.},

  abstract = {Relative motion breaks a camouflaged target from a same-textured background, thus eliciting discrimination of a motion-defined object. Ring (R) neurons are critical components in the               Drosophila               central complex, which has been implicated in multiple visually guided behaviors. Using two-photon calcium imaging with female flies, we demonstrated that a specific population of R neurons that innervate the superior domain of bulb neuropil, termed superior R neurons, encoded a motion-defined bar with high spatial frequency contents. Upstream superior tuberculo-bulbar (TuBu) neurons transmitted visual signals by releasing acetylcholine within synapses connected with superior R neurons. Blocking TuBu or R neurons impaired tracking performance of the bar, which reveals their importance in motion-defined feature encoding. Additionally, the presentation of a low spatial frequency luminance-defined bar evoked consistent excitation in R neurons of the superior bulb, whereas either excited or inhibited responses were evoked in the inferior bulb. The distinct properties of the responses to the two bar stimuli indicate there is a functional division between the bulb subdomains. Moreover, physiological and behavioral tests with restricted lines suggest that R4d neurons play a vital role in tracking motion-defined bars. We conclude that the central complex receives the motion-defined features via a visual pathway from superior TuBu to R neurons and might encode different visual features via distinct response patterns at the population level, thereby driving visually guided behaviors.                                         SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT               Animals could discriminate a motion-defined object that is indistinguishable with a same-textured background until it moves, but little is known about the underlying neural mechanisms. In this study, we identified that R neurons and their upstream partners, TuBu neurons, innervating the superior bulb of               Drosophila               central brain are involved in the discrimination of high-frequency motion-defined bars. Our study provides new evidence that R neurons receive multiple visual inputs from distinct upstream neurons, indicating a population coding mechanism for the fly central brain to discriminate diverse visual features. These results build progress in unraveling neural substrates for visually guided behaviors.},

  abstract = {The advantages of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, including low genetic redundancy, functional simplicity, and the ability to conduct large-scale genetic screens, have been essential for understanding the molecular nature of circadian ({$\sim$}24~hr) rhythms, and continue to be valuable in discovering novel regulators of circadian rhythms and sleep. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of these interrelated biological processes in Drosophila and the wider implications of this research. Clock genes period and timeless were first discovered in large-scale Drosophila genetic screens developed in the 1970s. Feedback of period and timeless on their own transcription forms the core of the molecular clock, and accurately timed expression, localization, post-transcriptional modification, and function of these genes is thought to be critical for maintaining the circadian cycle. Regulators, including several phosphatases and kinases, act on different steps of this feedback loop to ensure strong and accurately timed rhythms. Approximately 150 neurons in the fly brain that contain the core components of the molecular clock act together to translate this intracellular cycling into rhythmic behavior. We discuss how different groups of clock neurons serve different functions in allowing clocks to entrain to environmental cues, driving behavioral outputs at different times of day, and allowing flexible behavioral responses in different environmental conditions. The neuropeptide PDF provides an important signal thought to synchronize clock neurons, although the details of how PDF accomplishes this function are still being explored. Secreted signals from clock neurons also influence rhythms in other tissues. SLEEP is, in part, regulated by the circadian clock, which ensures appropriate timing of sleep, but the amount and quality of sleep are also determined by other mechanisms that ensure a homeostatic balance between sleep and wake. Flies have been useful for identifying a large set of genes, molecules, and neuroanatomic loci important for regulating sleep amount. Conserved aspects of sleep regulation in flies and mammals include wake-promoting roles for catecholamine neurotransmitters and involvement of hypothalamus-like regions, although other neuroanatomic regions implicated in sleep in flies have less clear parallels. Sleep is also subject to regulation by factors such as food availability, stress, and social environment. We are beginning to understand how the identified molecules and neurons interact with each other, and with the environment, to regulate sleep. Drosophila researchers can also take advantage of increasing mechanistic understanding of other behaviors, such as learning and memory, courtship, and aggression, to understand how sleep loss impacts these behaviors. Flies thus remain a valuable tool for both discovery of novel molecules and deep mechanistic understanding of sleep and circadian rhythms.},

  abstract = {Circadian rhythms have been extensively studied in               Drosophila               ; however, still little is known about how the electrical properties of clock neurons are specified. We have performed a behavioral genetic screen through the downregulation of candidate ion channels in the lateral ventral neurons (LNvs) and show that the hyperpolarization-activated cation current I               h               is important for the behaviors that the LNvs influence: temporal organization of locomotor activity, analyzed in males, and sleep, analyzed in females. Using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology we demonstrate that small LNvs (sLNvs) are bursting neurons, and that I               h               is necessary to achieve the high-frequency bursting firing pattern characteristic of both types of LNvs in females. Since firing in bursts has been associated to neuropeptide release, we hypothesized that I               h               would be important for LNvs communication. Indeed, herein we demonstrate that I               h               is fundamental for the recruitment of pigment dispersing factor (PDF) filled dense core vesicles (DCVs) to the terminals at the dorsal protocerebrum and for their timed release, and hence for the temporal coordination of circadian behaviors.                                         SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT               Ion channels are transmembrane proteins with selective permeability to specific charged particles. The rich repertoire of parameters that may gate their opening state, such as voltage-sensitivity, modulation by second messengers and specific kinetics, make this protein family a determinant of neuronal identity. Ion channel structure is evolutionary conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates, making any discovery easily translatable. Through a screen to uncover ion channels with roles in circadian rhythms, we have identified the I               h               channel as an important player in a subset of clock neurons of the fruit fly. We show that lateral ventral neurons (LNvs) need I               h               to fire action potentials in a high-frequency bursting mode and that this is important for peptide transport and the control of behavior.},

  abstract = {Rhythms are intrinsic to biological processes across temporal and spatial scales. In the brain, the synchronized oscillatory activity of neurons creates collective rhythms that are essential for complex functions. While this is a recognized phenomenon in the mammalian brain, information about insect neuronal synchrony and its underlying mechanisms is scarce. In the fly brain, neuronal oscillations were reported in individual lateral ventral neurons (LNvs), which play a key role in circadian and sleep behaviors. However, it is still unclear whether and how these participate in a collective rhythm. In this work, we perform thorough whole-cell patch clamp recordings of LNvs, and demonstrate consistent membrane potential oscillations. We show that oscillations degrade over time, and disappear upon exposure to an acetylcholine receptor blocker. Together with a flat phase response curve, these results suggest that oscillations are exogenously produced. Prompted by these results, we propose a generic forced oscillator theory that can account for the experimental phase response. The theory further predicts that neurons with similar properties should oscillate in synchrony with zero lags, while neurons with different properties may show coherent oscillations with non-zero lags. We confirm this prediction through simultaneous patch clamp recordings of neuronal pairs, revealing that large LNvs are consistently advanced relative to small LNvs. Additionally, we find that other neurons in the accessory medulla also exhibit coherent membrane potential oscillations, with diverse lags. Our findings suggest the intriguing possibility that brain waves may arise from collective neuronal activity within this region of the fly brain.},

The signals between neurons and glia include ion fluxes, neurotransmitters, cell adhesion molecules, and specialized signaling molecules released from synaptic and nonsynaptic regions of the neuron. In contrast to the serial flow of information along chains of neurons, glia communicate with other glial cells through intracellular waves of calcium and via intercellular diffusion of chemical messengers. By releasing neurotransmitters and other extracellular signaling molecules, glia can affect neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission and perhaps coordinate activity across networks of neurons.},

  abstract = {We highlight that the robustness and tunability of a bursting model critically rely on currents that provide slow positive feedback to the membrane potential. Such currents have the ability to make the total conductance of the circuit negative in a timescale that is termed ``slow'' because it is intermediate between the fast timescale of the spike upstroke and the ultraslow timescale of even slower adaptation currents. We discuss how such currents can be assessed either in voltage-clamp experiments or in computational models. We show that, while frequent in the literature, mathematical and computational models of bursting that lack the slow negative conductance are fragile and rigid. Our results suggest that modeling the slow negative conductance of cellular models is important when studying the neuromodulation of rhythmic circuits at any broader scale.             NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Nervous system functions rely on the modulation of neuronal activity between different rhythmic patterns. The mechanisms of this modulation are still poorly understood. Using computational modeling, we show the critical role of currents that provide slow negative conductance, distinct from the fast negative conductance necessary for spike generation. The significance of the slow negative conductance for neuromodulation is often overlooked, leading to computational models that are rigid and fragile.},

  abstract = {The electrical characteristics of many neurons are remarkably robust in the face of changing internal and external conditions. At the same time, neurons can be highly sensitive to neuromodulators. We find correlates of this dual robustness and sensitivity in a global analysis of the structure of a conductance-based model neuron. We vary the maximal conductance parameters of the model neuron and, for each set of parameters tested, characterize the activity pattern generated by the cell as silent, tonically firing, or bursting. Within the parameter space of the five maximal conductances of the model, we find directions, representing concerted changes in multiple conductances, along which the basic pattern of neural activity does not change. In other directions, relatively small concurrent changes in a few conductances can induce transitions between these activity patterns. The global structure of the conductance-space maps implies that neuromodulators that alter a sensitive set of conductances will have powerful, and possibly state-dependent, effects. Other modulators that may have no direct impact on the activity of the neuron may nevertheless change the effects of such direct modulators via this state dependence. Some of the results and predictions arising from the model studies are replicated and verified in recordings of stomatogastric ganglion neurons using the dynamic clamp.},

  abstract = {The intrinsic firing modes of adult CA1 pyramidal cells vary along a continuum of ``burstiness'' from regular firing to rhythmic bursting, depending on the ionic composition of the extracellular milieu. Burstiness is low in neurons exposed to a normal extracellular Ca               2+               concentration ([Ca               2+               ]               o               ), but is markedly enhanced by lowering [Ca               2+               ]               o               , although not by blocking Ca               2+               and Ca               2+               -activated K               +               currents. We show, using intracellular recordings, that burstiness in low [Ca               2+               ]               o               persists even after truncating the apical dendrites, suggesting that bursts are generated by an interplay of membrane currents at or near the soma. To study the mechanisms of bursting, we have constructed a conductance-based, one-compartment model of CA1 pyramidal neurons. In this neuron model, reduced [Ca               2+               ]               o               is simulated by negatively shifting the activation curve of the persistent Na               +               current ( I               NaP               ) as indicated by recent experimental results. The neuron model accounts, with different parameter sets, for the diversity of firing patterns observed experimentally in both zero and normal [Ca               2+               ]               o               . Increasing I               NaP               in the neuron model induces bursting and increases the number of spikes within a burst but is neither necessary nor sufficient for bursting. We show, using fast-slow analysis and bifurcation theory, that the M-type K               +               current ( I               M               ) allows bursting by shifting neuronal behavior between a silent and a tonically active state provided the kinetics of the spike generating currents are sufficiently, although not extremely, fast. We suggest that bursting in CA1 pyramidal cells can be explained by a single compartment ``square bursting'' mechanism with one slow variable, the activation of I               M               .},

However, almost nothing is known about how electrical signals propagate in               Drosophila               neurons. Here, we address these issues in antennal lobe projection neurons, one of the most well studied classes of               Drosophila               neurons. We use morphological and electrophysiological data to deduce the passive membrane properties of these neurons and to build a compartmental model of their electrotonic structure. We find that these neurons are electrotonically extensive and that a somatic recording electrode can only imperfectly control the voltage in the rest of the cell. Simulations predict that action potentials initiate at a location distant from the soma, in the proximal portion of the axon. Simulated synaptic input to a single dendritic branch propagates poorly to the rest of the cell and cannot match the size of real unitary synaptic events, but we can obtain a good fit to data when we model unitary input synapses as dozens of release sites distributed across many dendritic branches. We also show that the true resting potential of these neurons is more hyperpolarized than previously thought, attributable to the experimental error introduced by the electrode seal conductance. A leak sodium conductance also contributes to the resting potential. Together, these findings have fundamental implications for how these neurons integrate their synaptic inputs. Our results also have important consequences for the design and interpretation of experiments aimed at understanding               Drosophila               neurons and neural circuits.},

  abstract = {1. The properties of the Ca channel in tissue cultured clonal cells (GH               3               ) isolated from a rat anterior pituitary tumour were studied with the patch electrode voltage-clamp technique.                                         2. To isolate the current through the Ca channel, the currents through the Na channel, the delayed K channel and the Ca               2+               induced K channel were minimized by replacing the external Na               +               with TEA               +               and adding EGTA to the K-free solution inside the patch electrode.                                         3. The selectivity ratios through the Ca channel with different cations were 2{$\cdot$}7 (Ba               2+               ):1{$\cdot$}6 (Sr               2+               ):1{$\cdot$}0 (Ca               2+               ) and the               m               2               form of the activation kinetics and the relationships between the time constant and the membrane potential were common to the three divalent cations.                                         4. The amplitude of the Ba               2+               current increased linearly with [Ba               2+               ]               o               up to 25 mM and thereafter tended to show saturation.                                         5. The current---voltage relation showed a positive shift along the voltage axis as [Ba               2+               ]               o               increased, probably due to the screening effect of Ba               2+               on the negative surface charges.                                         6. The time constant of activation as a function of the membrane potential showed a parallel shift as [Ba               2+               ]               o               was increased, suggesting that the activation kinetics were independent of the permeant ion concentration.                                         7. The time constant of the tail current was consistent with               m               2               kinetics for opening and closing of the Ca channel.                          8. The extrapolated `instantaneous' tail current rapidly increased as the activating membrane potential became more positive and reached an apparent saturation at membrane potentials substantially more positive than the potential that gave the maximum peak inward current, and suggested that the single channel has a sigmoidal current---voltage relationship.                            9. The power density spectrum obtained during the steady-state inward Ba               2+               current had a cut-off frequency which was nearly voltage independent; this is expected if the fluctuation of the current originates from               m               2               activation kinetics.                                         10. The results of noise analysis suggest that the amplitude of the single Ca channel current was about 0{$\cdot$}2 pA at 25 mM-Ba               2+               and 0{$\cdot$}7 pA at 100 mM-Ba               2+               for membrane potentials in the vicinity of the maximum inward current.},

  abstract = {Neuroscientists have become used to a number of ``facts'' about the human brain: It has 100 billion neurons and 10- to 50-fold more glial cells; it is the largest-than-expected for its body among primates and mammals in general, and therefore the most cognitively able; it consumes an outstanding 20\% of the total body energy budget despite representing only 2\% of body mass because of an increased metabolic need of its neurons; and it is endowed with an overdeveloped cerebral cortex, the largest compared with brain size. These facts led to the widespread notion that the human brain is literally extraordinary: an outlier among mammalian brains, defying evolutionary rules that apply to other species, with a uniqueness seemingly necessary to justify the superior cognitive abilities of humans over mammals with even larger brains. These facts, with deep implications for neurophysiology and evolutionary biology, are not grounded on solid evidence or sound assumptions, however. Our recent development of a method that allows rapid and reliable quantification of the numbers of cells that compose the whole brain has provided a means to verify these facts. Here, I review this recent evidence and argue that, with 86 billion neurons and just as many nonneuronal cells, the human brain is a scaled-up primate brain in its cellular composition and metabolic cost, with a relatively enlarged cerebral cortex that does not have a relatively larger number of brain neurons yet is remarkable in its cognitive abilities and metabolism simply because of its extremely large number of neurons.},

  abstract = {The inhibitory GABAergic projection of thalamic nucleus reticularis (nRt) neurons onto thalamocortical relay cells (TCs) is important in generating the normal thalamocortical rhythmicity of slow wave sleep, and may be a key element in the production of abnormal rhythms associated with absence epilepsy. Both TCs and nRt cells can generate prominent Ca(2+)-dependent low-threshold spikes, which evoke bursts of Na(+)-dependent fast spikes, and are influential in rhythm generation. Substantial differences in the pattern of burst firing in TCs versus nRt neurons led us to hypothesize that there are distinct forms of transient Ca2+ current (I(T)) underlying burst discharges in these two cell types. Using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, we analyzed I(T) in acutely isolated TCs and nRt neurons and found three key differences in biophysical properties. (1) The transient Ca2+ current in nRt neurons inactivated much more slowly than I(T) in TCs. This slow current is thus termed I(Ts). (2) The rate of inactivation for I(Ts) was nearly voltage independent. (3) Whole-cell I(Ts) amplitude was increased when Ba2+ was substituted for Ca2+ as the charge carrier. In addition, activation kinetics were slower for I(Ts) and the activation range was depolarized compared to that for I(T). Other properties of I(Ts) and I(T) were similar, including steady-state inactivation and sensitivities to blockade by divalent cations, amiloride, and antiepileptic drugs. Our findings demonstrate that subtypes of transient Ca2+ current are present in two different classes of thalamic neurons. The properties of I(Ts) lead to generation of long-duration calcium-dependent spike bursts in nRt cells. The resultant prolonged periods of GABA release onto TCs would play a critical role in maintaining rhythmicity by inducing TC hyperpolarization and promoting generation of low-threshold calcium spikes within relay nuclei.},

  abstract = {1. To perform simulations of the various modes of action potential generation in thalamic relay neurons, we developed Hodgkin-and-Huxley style mathematical equations that describe the voltage dependence and kinetics of activation and inactivation of four different currents, including the transient, low-voltage-activated Ca2+ current (IT), the rapidly inactivating transient K+ current (IA), the slowly inactivating K+ current (IK2), and the hyperpolarization-activated, mixed cationic current (Ih). The modeled currents were derived either from acutely dissociated rat thalamic relay neurons (IT, IA, IK2), or from guinea pig thalamic relay cells maintained in slices in vitro (Ih). 2. The voltage dependence of steady-state activation and inactivation of IT, IA, and IK2 and the activation of Ih could be modeled with Boltzmann-style equations. Modeling of the behavior of IT to depolarizing steps in voltage clamp required the use of the constant field equation to relate permeability to T-current amplitude. The time constant of activation of IT was described by a continuous bell-shaped function with a maximum near 15 ms at threshold for activation (-75 mV) and 23 degrees C. Mathematical description of the kinetics of inactivation and removal of inactivation of this current required two separate functions. 3. The rapidly activating and inactivating K+ current IA was modeled by assuming two components with different time constants of inactivation. The kinetics of activation was described as a continuous function of voltage with the slowest time constant, near 2.5 ms, at threshold for activation (-60 mV) and 23 degrees C. In contrast, the kinetics of inactivation of both components were described as voltage independent, consistent with experimental data. The rate or removal of inactivation of both components of IA was described as continuously increasing with the degree of hyperpolarization. 4. The slowly inactivating K+ current IK2 was also modeled by assuming two components with different rates of inactivation. The kinetics of activation were described by a bell-shaped function with a maximum time constant near 80 ms at -40 mV and 23 degrees C, whereas threshold for activation was approximately -60 mV. Inactivation of both components was modeled as relatively independent of voltage, whereas removal of inactivation was described as a continuous function of membrane potential. 5. The hyperpolarization-activation cationic current, Ih, was modeled by assuming that the current activates with a single exponential relation and does not inactivate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {A typical neuron signals to downstream cells when it is depolarized and firing sodium spikes. Some neurons, however, also fire calcium spikes when hyperpolarized. The function of such bidirectional signaling remains unclear in most circuits. Here we show how a neuron class that participates in vector computation in the fly central complex employs hyperpolarization-elicited calcium spikes to invert two-dimensional mathematical vectors. When cells switch from firing sodium to calcium spikes, this leads to a \textasciitilde 180{$^\circ$} realignment between the vector encoded in the neuronal population and the fly's internal heading signal, thus inverting the vector. We show that the calcium spikes rely on the T-type calcium channel Ca-{$\alpha$}1T, and argue, via analytical and experimental approaches, that these spikes enable vector computations in portions of angular space that would otherwise be inaccessible. These results reveal a seamless interaction between molecular, cellular and circuit properties for implementing vector math in the brain.},

  abstract = {Explains the relationship of electrophysiology, nonlinear dynamics, and the computational properties of neurons, with each concept presented in terms of both neuroscience and mathematics and illustrated using geometrical intuition.             In order to model neuronal behavior or to interpret the results of modeling studies, neuroscientists must call upon methods of nonlinear dynamics. This book offers an introduction to nonlinear dynamical systems theory for researchers and graduate students in neuroscience. It also provides an overview of neuroscience for mathematicians who want to learn the basic facts of electrophysiology.             Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience presents a systematic study of the relationship of electrophysiology, nonlinear dynamics, and computational properties of neurons. It emphasizes that information processing in the brain depends not only on the electrophysiological properties of neurons but also on their dynamical properties. The book introduces dynamical systems, starting with one- and two-dimensional Hodgkin-Huxley-type models and continuing to a description of bursting systems. Each chapter proceeds from the simple to the complex, and provides sample problems at the end. The book explains all necessary mathematical concepts using geometrical intuition; it includes many figures and few equations, making it especially suitable for non-mathematicians. Each concept is presented in terms of both neuroscience and mathematics, providing a link between the two disciplines.             Nonlinear dynamical systems theory is at the core of computational neuroscience research, but it is not a standard part of the graduate neuroscience curriculum---or taught by math or physics department in a way that is suitable for students of biology. This book offers neuroscience students and researchers a comprehensive account of concepts and methods increasingly used in computational neuroscience.

  abstract = {Bifurcation mechanisms involved in the generation of action potentials (spikes) by neurons are reviewed here. We show how the type of bifurcation determines the neuro-computational properties of the cells. For example, when the rest state is near a saddle-node bifurcation, the cell can fire all-or-none spikes with an arbitrary low frequency, it has a well-defined threshold manifold, and it acts as an integrator; i.e. the higher the frequency of incoming pulses, the sooner it fires. In contrast, when the rest state is near an Andronov--Hopf bifurcation, the cell fires in a certain frequency range, its spikes are not all-or-none, it does not have a well-defined threshold manifold, it can fire in response to an inhibitory pulse, and it acts as a resonator; i.e. it responds preferentially to a certain (resonant) frequency of the input. Increasing the input frequency may actually delay or terminate its firing.             We also describe the phenomenon of neural bursting, and we use geometric bifurcation theory to extend the existing classification of bursters, including many new types. We discuss how the type of burster defines its neuro-computational properties, and we show that different bursters can interact, synchronize and process information differently.},

  abstract = {Mammalian T-type Ca(2+) channels are encoded by three separate genes (Cav3.1, 3.2, 3.3). These channels are reported to be sleep stabilizers important in the generation of the delta rhythms of deep sleep, but controversy remains. The identification of precise physiological functions for the T-type channels has been hindered, at least in part, by the potential for compensation between the products of these three genes and a lack of specific pharmacological inhibitors. Invertebrates have only one T-type channel gene, but its functions are even less well-studied. We cloned Ca-{$\alpha$}1T, the only Cav3 channel gene in Drosophila melanogaster, expressed it in Xenopus oocytes and HEK-293 cells, and confirmed it passes typical T-type currents. Voltage-clamp analysis revealed the biophysical properties of Ca-{$\alpha$}1T show mixed similarity, sometimes falling closer to Cav3.1, sometimes to Cav3.2, and sometimes to Cav3.3. We found Ca-{$\alpha$}1T is broadly expressed across the adult fly brain in a pattern vaguely reminiscent of mammalian T-type channels. In addition, flies lacking Ca-{$\alpha$}1T show an abnormal increase in sleep duration most pronounced during subjective day under continuous dark conditions despite normal oscillations of the circadian clock. Thus, our study suggests invertebrate T-type Ca(2+) channels promote wakefulness rather than stabilizing sleep.},

  abstract = {Behaviorally adequate neuronal firing patterns are critically dependent on the specific types of ion channel expressed and on their subcellular localization. This study combines               in situ               electrophysiology with genetic and pharmacological intervention in larval               Drosophila melanogaster               of both sexes to address localization and function of L-type like calcium channels in motoneurons. We demonstrate that Dmca1D (Ca               v               1 homolog) L-type like calcium channels localize to both the somatodendritic and the axonal compartment of larval crawling motoneurons.               In situ               patch-clamp recordings in genetic mosaics reveal that Dmca1D channels increase burst duration and maximum intraburst firing frequencies during crawling-like motor patterns in semi-intact animals. Genetic and acute pharmacological manipulations suggest that prolonged burst durations are caused by dendritically localized Dmca1D channels, which activate upon cholinergic synaptic input and amplify EPSPs, thus indicating a conserved function of dendritic L-type channels from               Drosophila               to vertebrates. By contrast, maximum intraburst firing rates require axonal calcium influx through Dmca1D channels, likely to enhance sodium channel de-inactivation via a fast afterhyperpolarization through BK channel activation. Therefore, in unmyelinated               Drosophila               motoneurons different functions of axonal and dendritic L-type like calcium channels likely operate synergistically to maximize firing output during locomotion.                                         SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT               Nervous system function depends on the specific excitabilities of different types of neurons. Excitability is largely shaped by different combinations of voltage-dependent ion channels. Despite a high degree of conservation, the huge diversity of ion channel types and their differential localization pose challenges in assigning distinct functions to specific channels across species. We find a conserved role, from fruit flies to mammals, for L-type calcium channels in augmenting motoneuron excitability. As in spinal cord, dendritic L-type channels amplify excitatory synaptic input. In contrast to spinal motoneurons, axonal L-type channels enhance firing rates in unmyelinated               Drosophila               motoraxons. Therefore, enhancing motoneuron excitability by L-type channels seems an old strategy, but localization and interactions with other channels are tuned to species-specific requirements.},

  abstract = {We examined the concentration dependence of currents through CaV3.1 T-type calcium channels, varying Ca2+ and Ba2+ over a wide concentration range (100 nM to 110 mM) while recording whole-cell currents over a wide voltage range from channels stably expressed in HEK 293 cells. To isolate effects on permeation, instantaneous current--voltage relationships (IIV) were obtained following strong, brief depolarizations to activate channels with minimal inactivation. Reversal potentials were described by PCa/PNa = 87 and PCa/PBa = 2, based on Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz theory. However, analysis of chord conductances found that apparent Kd values were similar for Ca2+ and Ba2+, both for block of currents carried by Na+ (3 {$\mu$}M for Ca2+ vs. 4 {$\mu$}M for Ba2+, at -30 mV; weaker at more positive or negative voltages) and for permeation (3.3 mM for Ca2+ vs. 2.5 mM for Ba2+; nearly voltage independent). Block by 3--10 {$\mu$}M Ca2+ was time dependent, described by bimolecular kinetics with binding at {$\sim$}3 \texttimes{} 108 M-1s-1 and voltage-dependent exit. Ca2+o, Ba2+o, and Mg2+o also affected channel gating, primarily by shifting channel activation, consistent with screening a surface charge of 1 e- per 98 \AA 2 from Gouy-Chapman theory. Additionally, inward currents inactivated {$\sim$}35\% faster in Ba2+o (vs. Ca2+o or Na+o). The accelerated inactivation in Ba2+o correlated with the transition from Na+ to Ba2+ permeation, suggesting that Ba2+o speeds inactivation by occupying the pore. We conclude that the selectivity of the ``surface charge'' among divalent cations differs between calcium channel families, implying that the surface charge is channel specific. Voltage strongly affects the concentration dependence of block, but not of permeation, for Ca2+ or Ba2+.},

  abstract = {Calcium dynamics associated with a single action potential (AP) were studied in single boutons of the axonal arbor of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the neocortex of young (P14-16) rats. We used fluorescence imaging with two-photon excitation and Ca2+-selective fluorescence indicators to measure volume-averaged Ca2+ signals. These rapidly reached a peak (in about 1 ms) and then decayed more slowly (tens to hundreds of milliseconds). Single APs and trains of APs reliably evoked Ca2+ transients in en passant boutons located on axon collaterals in cortical layers 2/3, 4 and 5, indicating that APs propagate actively and reliably throughout the axonal arbor. Branch point failures are unlikely to contribute to differences in synaptic efficacy and reliability in the connections made by layer 2/3 pyramidal cells. AP-evoked Ca2+ transients in boutons were mediated by voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs), predominantly by the P/Q- and N-subtypes. Ca2+ transients were, on average, of significantly larger amplitude in boutons than in the flanking segments of the axon collateral. Large amplitude Ca2+ transients in boutons were spatially restricted to within {$<$}= 3 m of axonal length. Single AP-evoked Ca2+ transients varied up to 10-fold across different boutons even if they were located on the same axon collateral. In contrast, variation of Ca2+ transients evoked by successive APs in a given single bouton was small (coefficient of variation, c.v. {$<$}= 0.21). Amplitudes of AP-evoked Ca2+ signals did not correlate with the distance of boutons from the soma. In contrast, AP-evoked Ca2+ signals in spines of basal dendrites decreased slightly (correlation coefficient, r2 = -0.27) with distance from the soma. Measurements with the low-affinity Ca2+ indicator Magnesium Green suggest that the volume-averaged residual free [Ca2+]i in a bouton increases on average by 500 nM following a single AP. Higher concentrations of indicator caused, on average, a decrease in the amplitude and an increase in the decay time constant of Ca2+ transients. Assuming a single-compartment model the concentration dependence of decay time constants suggests a low endogenous Ca2+ binding ratio close to 140, indicating that of the total Ca2+ influx ( approximately 2 fC) less than 1\% remained free. The indicator concentration dependence of decay time constants further suggests that the residual free Delta[Ca2+]i associated with an AP decays with a time constant of about 60 ms (35 C) reflecting a high Ca2+ extrusion rate of about 2600 s(-1). The results show that AP-evoked volume-averaged Ca2+ transients in single boutons are evoked reliably and, on average, have larger amplitudes than Ca2+ transients in other subcellular compartments of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells. A major functional signature is the large variation in the amplitude of Ca2+ transients between different boutons. This could indicate that local interactions between boutons and different target cells modify the spatiotemporal Ca2+ dynamics in boutons and cause target cell-specific differences in their transmitter release properties.},

  abstract = {Activity of voltage-gated Na channels (Na               v               ) is modified by alternative splicing. However, whether altered splicing of human Na               v               s contributes to epilepsy remains to be conclusively shown. We show here that altered splicing of the               Drosophila               Na               v               (               paralytic               ,                                DmNa                 v                              ) contributes to seizure-like behavior in identified seizure mutants. We focus attention on a pair of mutually exclusive alternate exons (termed               K               and               L               ), which form part of the voltage sensor (S4) in domain III of the expressed channel. The presence of exon               L               results in a large, non-inactivating, persistent               I               Nap               . Many forms of human epilepsy are associated with an increase in this current. In wild-type (WT)               Drosophila               larvae, {$\sim$}70--80\% of                                DmNa                 v                              transcripts contain exon               L               , and the remainder contain exon               K               . Splicing of                                DmNa                 v                              to include exon               L               is increased to {$\sim$}100\% in both the               slamdance               and               easily-shocked               seizure mutants. This change to splicing is prevented by reducing synaptic activity levels through exposure to the antiepileptic phenytoin or the inhibitory transmitter GABA. Conversely, enhancing synaptic activity in WT, by feeding of picrotoxin is sufficient to increase               I               Nap               and promote seizure through increased inclusion of exon               L               to 100\%. We also show that the underlying activity-dependent mechanism requires the presence of Pasilla, an RNA-binding protein. Finally, we use computational modeling to show that increasing               I               Nap               is sufficient to potentiate membrane excitability consistent with a seizure phenotype. Thus, increased synaptic excitation favors inclusion of exon               L               , which, in turn, further increases neuronal excitability. Thus, at least in               Drosophila               , this self-reinforcing cycle may promote the incidence of seizure.},

  abstract = {Diversity in neuronal signaling is a product not only of differential gene expression, but also of alternative splicing. However, although recognized, the precise contribution of alternative splicing in ion channel transcripts to channel kinetics remains poorly understood. Invertebrates, with their smaller genomes, offer attractive models to examine the contribution of splicing to neuronal function. In this study we report the sequencing and biophysical characterization of alternative splice variants of the sole voltage-gated Na               +               gene ( DmNa               v               , paralytic), in late-stage embryos of Drosophila melanogaster. We identify 27 unique splice variants, based on the presence of 15 alternative exons. Heterologous expression, in Xenopus oocytes, shows that alternative exons j, e, and f primarily influence activation kinetics: when present, exon f confers a hyperpolarizing shift in half-activation voltage ( V               1/2               ), whereas j and e result in a depolarizing shift. The presence of exon h is sufficient to produce a depolarizing shift in the V               1/2               of steady-state inactivation. The magnitude of the persistent Na               +               current, but not the fast-inactivating current, in both oocytes and Drosophila motoneurons in vivo is directly influenced by the presence of either one of a pair of mutually exclusive, membrane-spanning exons, termed k and L. Transcripts containing k have significantly smaller persistent currents compared with those containing L. Finally, we show that transcripts lacking all cytoplasmic alternatively spliced exons still produce functional channels, indicating that splicing may influence channel kinetics not only through change to protein structure, but also by allowing differential modification (i.e., phosphorylation, binding of cofactors, etc.). Our results provide a functional basis for understanding how alternative splicing of a voltage-gated Na               +               channel results in diversity in neuronal signaling.},

  abstract = {Membrane channels are subject to a wide variety of regulatory mechanisms that can be affected by activity. We present a model of a stomatogastric ganglion (STG) neuron in which several Ca               2+               -dependent pathways are used to regulate the maximal conductances of membrane currents in an activity-dependent manner. Unlike previous models of this type, the regulation and modification of maximal conductances by electrical activity is unconstrained. The model has seven voltage-dependent membrane currents and uses three Ca               2+               sensors acting on different time scales. Starting from random initial conditions over a given range, the model sets the maximal conductances for its active membrane currents to values that produce a predefined target pattern of activity {$\sim$}90\% of the time. In these models, the same pattern of electrical activity can be produced by a range of maximal conductances, and this range is compared with voltage-clamp data from the lateral pyloric neuron of the STG. If the electrical activity of the model neuron is perturbed, the maximal conductances adjust to restore the original pattern of activity. When the perturbation is removed, the activity pattern is again restored after a transient adjustment period, but the conductances may not return to their initial values. The model suggests that neurons may regulate their conductances to maintain fixed patterns of electrical activity, rather than fixed maximal conductances, and that the regulation process requires feedback systems capable of reacting to changes of electrical activity on a number of different time scales.},

  abstract = {External tufted (ET) cells are juxtaglomerular neurons that spontaneously generate bursts of action potentials, which persist when fast synaptic transmission is blocked. The intrinsic mechanism of this autonomous bursting is unknown. We identified a set of voltage-dependent conductances that cooperatively regulate spontaneous bursting: hyperpolarization-activated inward current (I(h)), persistent Na+ current (I(NaP)), low-voltage-activated calcium current (I(L/T)) mediated by T- and/or L-type Ca2+ channels, and large-conductance Ca2+-dependent K+ current (I(BK)). I(h) is important in setting membrane potential and depolarizes the cell toward the threshold of I(NaP) and I(T/L), which are essential to generate the depolarizing envelope that is crowned by a burst of action potentials. Action potentials depolarize the membrane and induce Ca2+ influx via high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channels (I(HVA)). The combined depolarization and increased intracellular Ca2+ activates I(BK), which terminates the burst by hyperpolarizing the membrane. Hyperpolarization activates I(h) and the cycle is regenerated. A novel finding is the role of L-type Ca2+ channels in autonomous ET cells bursting. A second novel feature is the role of BK channels, which regulate burst duration. I(L) and I(BK) may go hand-in-hand, the slow inactivation of I(L) requiring I(BK)-dependent hyperpolarization to deactivate inward conductances and terminate the burst. ET cells receive monosynaptic olfactory nerve input and drive the major inhibitory interneurons of the glomerular circuit. Modulation of the conductances identified here can regulate burst frequency, duration, and spikes per burst in ET cells and thus significantly shape the impact of glomerular circuits on mitral and tufted cells, the output channels of the olfactory bulb.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical study on the differences in the biomechanical parameters of the vocal folds between oscillation onset and offset. The dynamics of the oscillation is analyzed from the perspective of the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems, using a mucosal wave model of the vocal folds with the subglottal pressure and the vocal fold half-width as control parameters. It is shown that the oscillation onset occurs through a Hopf bifurcation of the subcritical type, at which an unstable limit cycle is generated. Also, the oscillation offset occurs at a cyclic fold bifurcation, at which the unstable limit cycle and a stable limit cycle (the actual vocal fold oscillation) coalesce and cancel each other. Both bifurcations combine to form an ``oscillation hysteresis'' phenomenon, common in cases of flow-induced oscillations. An analytical expression for the onset/offset ratio of parameters is derived. The onset/offset ratio is in the range of 0.5--1, in agreement with the experimental evidence. This value depends on the phase delay in motion of the upper edge of the vocal folds versus the lower edge, and on the particular model adopted for airflow separation within the glottis.},

  abstract = {1. A model of the electrophysiological properties of single thalamocortical relay neurons in the rodent and cat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus was constructed, based in part on the voltage dependence and kinetics of ionic currents detailed with voltage-clamp techniques. The model made the simplifying assumption of a single uniform compartment and incorporated a fast and transient Na+ current, INa; a persistent, depolarization-activated Na+ current, INap; a low-threshold Ca2+ current, I(T); a high-threshold Ca2+ current, IL; a Ca(2+)-activated K+ current, IC; a transient and depolarization-activated K+ current, IA; a slowly inactivating and depolarization-activated K+ current, IK2; a hyperpolarization-activated cation current, Ih; and K+ and Na+ leak currents IKleak and INaleak. 2. The effects of the various ionic currents on the electrophysiological properties of thalamocortical relay neurons were initially investigated through examining the effect of each current individually on passive membrane responses. The two leak currents, IKleak and INaleak, determined in large part the resting membrane potential and the apparent input resistance of the model neuron. Addition of IA resulted in a delay in the response of the model cell to a depolarizing current pulse, whereas addition of IK2, or IL combined with IC, resulted in a marked and prolonged decrease in the response to depolarization. Addition of Ih resulted in a depolarizing "sag" in response to hyperpolarization, whereas addition of IT resulted in a large rebound Ca2+ spike after hyperpolarization. Finally, addition of INap resulted in enhancement of depolarization. 3. The low-threshold Ca2+ spike of rodent neurons was successfully modeled with the active currents I(T), IL, IA, IC, and IK2. The low-threshold Ca2+ current I(T) generated the low-threshold Ca2+ spike. The transient K+ current IA slowed the rate of rise and reduced the peak amplitude of the low-threshold Ca2+ spike, whereas the slowly inactivating K+ current IK2 contributed greatly to the repolarization of the Ca2+ spike. Activation of IL during the peak of the Ca2+ spike led to activation of IC, which also contributed to the repolarization of the Ca2+ spike. Reduction of any one of the K+ currents resulted in an increase in the other two, thereby resulting in substantially smaller changes in the Ca2+ spike than would be expected on the basis of the amplitude of each ionic current alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Sodium currents were expressed in approximately 65\% of the neurons prepared from wild-type Drosophila embryos when examined at room temperature, 24 hr after plating. While current density was low, other features of the sodium current in wild-type neurons, including the voltage sensitivity, steady- state inactivation, macroscopic time course, and TTX sensitivity were similar to those found in other excitable cells. Physiological and biochemical evidence has led to the suggestion that mutations in the nap, seizure, and tip-E loci of Drosophila may affect voltage-dependent sodium channels. There was no significant difference in the percentage of neurons expressing sodium currents in cultures prepared from embryos with mutations at the nap, sei or tip-E loci compared with wild-type cultures. Sodium currents recorded from napts appeared similar in all of the properties examined to those in wild-type cells. However, neuronal sodium current density was 40--60\% lower in cultures prepared from both tip-E and seits1 embryos. The voltage dependence and gating properties of these sodium channels, as well as the TTX sensitivity, appear similar to wild type. These results indicate that both the tip-E and sei loci are important in regulation of sodium current density in embryonic neurons.},

  abstract = {Significance             A deep puzzle in neuroscience is how neurons maintain their electrical properties despite continuous ion channel turnover and activity perturbations. Previous work proposed that activity-dependent homeostatic rules ensure robust development of excitability by regulating channel density, although it is not understood how these rules shape the distribution of ion channel types nor how finely tuned these rules must be. We show that generic homeostatic regulation rules impose correlations in the steady-state distribution of ion channels, as has been recently observed experimentally. Specific correlations depend on relative expression rates, and the regulation rules themselves are far more robust than previously thought.           ,              Experimental observations reveal that the expression levels of different ion channels vary across neurons of a defined type, even when these neurons exhibit stereotyped electrical properties. However, there are robust correlations between different ion channel expression levels, although the mechanisms that determine these correlations are unknown. Using generic model neurons, we show that correlated conductance expression can emerge from simple homeostatic control mechanisms that couple expression rates of individual conductances to cellular readouts of activity. The correlations depend on the relative rates of expression of different conductances. Thus, variability is consistent with homeostatic regulation and the structure of this variability reveals quantitative relations between regulation dynamics of different conductances. Furthermore, we show that homeostatic regulation is remarkably insensitive to the details that couple the regulation of a given conductance to overall neuronal activity because of degeneracy in the function of multiple conductances and can be robust to ``antihomeostatic'' regulation of a subset of conductances expressed in a cell.},

In a previous in vivo study we have proposed that these pauses in firing may be due to intrinsically generated afterhyperpolarisations (AHPs) evoked by excitatory synaptic inputs, including those below the threshold for action potential firing. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of the AHPs using a brain slice preparation which preserved both cerebral hemispheres. Augmenting cortically evoked postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) by repetitive stimulation of cortical afferents evoked AHPs that were unaffected by blocking either GABA(A) receptors with bicuculline, or GABA(B) receptors with saclofen or CGP55845. Apamin (a blocker of small conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels) had minimal effects, while chelation of intracellular Ca(2+) with BAPTA reduced the AHP by about 30\%. In contrast, blocking hyperpolarisation and cyclic nucleotide activated (HCN) cation current (I(H)) with ZD7288 or Cs(+) diminished the size of the AHPs by 60\% and reduced the proportion of episodes that contained this hyperpolarisation. The reversal potential (20 mV) and voltage dependence of the AHPs were consistent with the hypothesis that a transient deactivation of I(H) caused most of the AHP at hyperpolarised potentials, while the slow AHP-type Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels increasingly contributed at more depolarised membrane potentials. Subthreshold somatic current injections yielded similar AHPs with a median duration of approximately 700 ms that were not affected by firing of a single action potential. These results indicate that transient deactivation of HCN channels evokes pauses in tonic firing of cholinergic interneurons, an event likely to be elicited by augmentation of afferent synaptic inputs during learning.},

  abstract = {The subthalamic nucleus (STN) has an important role in the pathophysiology of the basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease. The ability of STN cells to generate bursting rhythms under either transient or sustained hyperpolarization may underlie the excessively synchronous beta rhythms observed in Parkinson's disease. In this study, we developed a conductance-based single compartment model of an STN neuron, which is able to generate characteristic activity patterns observed in experiments including hyperpolarization-induced bursts and post-inhibitory rebound bursts. This study focused on the role of three currents in rhythm generation: T-type calcium (CaT) current, L-type calcium (CaL) current, and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) current. To investigate the effects of these currents in rhythm generation, we performed a bifurcation analysis using slow variables in these currents. Bifurcation analysis showed that the HCN current promotes single-spike activity patterns rather than bursting in agreement with experimental results. It also showed that the CaT current is necessary for characteristic bursting activity patterns. In particular, the CaT current enables STN neurons to generate these activity patterns under hyperpolarizing stimuli. The CaL current enriches and reinforces these characteristic activity patterns. In hyperpolarization-induced bursts or post-inhibitory rebound bursts, the CaL current allows STN neurons to generate long bursting patterns. Thus, the bifurcation analysis explained the synergistic interaction of the CaT and CaL currents, which enables STN neurons to respond to hyperpolarizing stimuli in a salient way. The results of this study implicate the importance of CaT and CaL currents in the pathophysiology of the basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease.},

  abstract = {The collective electrophysiological dynamics of the brain as a result of sleep-related biological drives in Drosophila are investigated in this paper. Based on the Huber-Braun thermoreceptor model, the conductance-based neurons model is extended to a coupled neural network to analyze the local field potential (LFP). The LFP is calculated by using two different metrics: the mean value and the distance-dependent LFP. The distribution of neurons around the electrodes is assumed to have a circular or grid distribution on a two-dimensional plane. Regardless of which method is used, qualitatively similar results are obtained that are roughly consistent with the experimental data. During wake, the LFP has an irregular or a regular spike. However, the LFP becomes regular bursting during sleep. To further analyze the results, wavelet analysis and raster plots are used to examine how the LFP frequencies changed. The synchronization of neurons under different network structures is also studied. The results demonstrate that there are obvious oscillations at approximately 8 Hz during sleep that are absent during wake. Different time series of the LFP can be obtained under different network structures and the density of the network will also affect the magnitude of the potential. As the number of coupled neurons increases, the neural network becomes easier to synchronize, but the sleep and wake time described by the LFP spectrogram do not change. Moreover, the parameters that affect the durations of sleep and wake are analyzed.},

How neural interactions create brain states capable of dissociating an animal from its external world to promote quiescence remains a fundamental question. Here, we show how coherent network oscillations can create neural filters that favor a quiescent brain state over a state that promotes navigation. Circadian regulation and excitability of the             Drosophila             sleep homeostat (dFSB) generate nighttime specific slow-wave coherence between neural networks mediating sleep need (R5) and networks gating locomotion (helicon cells). Optogenetically mimicking coherent activity reveals that temporally fine-tuned R5 oscillations promote a quiescent state and reduce responsiveness to visual stimuli by hierarchically overruling locomotion-promoting helicon cells. We uncover that R5 and helicon bidirectionally regulate behavioral responsiveness by providing antagonistic inputs to head direction targets (EPG). Thus, coherent oscillations can form the mechanistic basis of neural filters by temporally associating antagonistic inputs and therefore reducing the functional connectivity between locomotion gating and navigational networks.},

  abstract = {In multipolar vertebrate neurons, action potentials (APs) initiate close to the soma, at the axonal initial segment. Invertebrate neurons are typically unipolar with dendrites integrating directly into the axon. Where APs are initiated in the axons of invertebrate neurons is unclear. Voltage-gated sodium (Na               V               ) channels are a functional hallmark of the axonal initial segment in vertebrates. We used an intronic               Minos               -Mediated Integration Cassette to determine the endogenous gene expression and subcellular localization of the sole Na               V               channel in both male and female               Drosophila               ,               para               . Despite being the only Na               V               channel in the fly, we show that only 23 \textpm{} 1\% of neurons in the embryonic and larval CNS express               para               , while in the adult CNS               para               is broadly expressed. We generated a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the whole third instar larval brain to identify               para               expressing neurons and show that it positively correlates with markers of differentiated, actively firing neurons. Therefore, only 23 \textpm{} 1\% of larval neurons may be capable of firing Na               V               -dependent APs. We then show that Para is enriched in an axonal segment, distal to the site of dendritic integration into the axon, which we named the distal axonal segment (DAS). The DAS is present in multiple neuron classes in both the third instar larval and adult CNS. Whole cell patch clamp electrophysiological recordings of adult CNS fly neurons are consistent with the interpretation that Na               v               -dependent APs originate in the DAS. Identification of the distal Na               V               localization in fly neurons will enable more accurate interpretation of electrophysiological recordings in invertebrates.                                         SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT               The site of action potential (AP) initiation in invertebrates is unknown. We tagged the sole voltage-gated sodium (Na               V               ) channel in the fly,               para               , and identified that Para is enriched at a distal axonal segment. The distal axonal segment is located distal to where dendrites impinge on axons and is the likely site of AP initiation. Understanding where APs are initiated improves our ability to model neuronal activity and our interpretation of electrophysiological data. Additionally,               para               is only expressed in 23 \textpm{} 1\% of third instar larval neurons but is broadly expressed in adults. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the third instar larval brain shows that               para               expression correlates with the expression of active, differentiated neuronal markers. Therefore, only 23 \textpm{} 1\% of third instar larval neurons may be able to actively fire Na               V               -dependent APs.},

  abstract = {Higher order thalamic neurons receive driving inputs from cortical layer 5 and project back to the cortex, reflecting a transthalamic route for corticocortical communication. To determine whether or not individual neurons integrate signals from different cortical populations, we combined electron microscopy "connectomics" in mice with genetic labeling to disambiguate layer 5 synapses from somatosensory and motor cortices to the higher order thalamic posterior medial nucleus. A significant convergence of these inputs was found on 19 of 33 reconstructed thalamic cells, and as a population, the layer 5 synapses were larger and located more proximally on dendrites than were unlabeled synapses. Thus, many or most of these thalamic neurons do not simply relay afferent information but instead integrate signals as disparate in this case as those emanating from sensory and motor cortices. These findings add further depth and complexity to the role of the higher order thalamus in overall cortical functioning.},

IP               3               Rs are co-activated by IP               3               and Ca               2+               , inhibited by Ca               2+               at high concentrations, and potentiated by ATP.

  abstract = {Within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, circadian timekeeping and resetting have been shown to be largely dependent on both membrane depolarization and intracellular second-messenger signaling. In both of these processes, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) mediate voltage-dependent calcium influx, which propagates neural impulses by stimulating vesicle fusion and instigates intracellular pathways resulting in clock gene expression. Through the cumulative actions of these processes, the phase of the internal clock is modified to match the light cycle of the external environment. To parse out the distinct roles of the L-type VGCCs, we analyzed mice deficient in Ca               v               1.2 ( Cacna1c) in brain tissue. We found that mice deficient in the Ca               v               1.2 channel exhibited a significant reduction in their ability to phase-advance circadian behavior when subjected to a light pulse in the late night. Furthermore, the study revealed that the expression of Ca               v               1.2 mRNA was rhythmic (peaking during the late night) and was regulated by the circadian clock component REV-ERB{$\alpha$}. Finally, the induction of clock genes in both the early and late subjective night was affected by the loss of Ca               v               1.2, with reductions in Per2 and Per1 in the early and late night, respectively. In sum, these results reveal a role of the L-type VGCC Ca               v               1.2 in mediating both clock gene expression and phase advances in response to a light pulse in the late night.},

Each lineage exhibits a stereotypical branching pattern and trajectory, which distinguish it from other lineages. In this study, we used a multilineage approach to explore the neural function of the Par-complex member Par3/Bazooka               in vivo               .               Drosophila bazooka               is expressed in post-mitotic neurons of the larval brain and localizes within neurons in a lineage-dependent manner. The fact that multiple GAL4 drivers have been mapped to several lineages of the               Drosophila               brain enables investigation of the role of Bazooka from larval to adult stages               Bazooka               loss-of-function (LOF) clones had abnormal morphologies, including aberrant pathway choice of ventral projection neurons in the BAla1 lineage, ectopic branching in the DALv2 and BAmv1 lineages, and excess BLD5 lineage axon projections in the optic medulla. Exogenous expression of Bazooka protein in BAla1 neurons rescued defective guidance, supporting an intrinsic requirement for Bazooka in the post-mitotic neuron. Elimination of the Par-complex member Par6 recapitulated Bazooka phenotypes in some but not all lineages, suggesting that the Par complex functions in a lineage-dependent manner, and that Bazooka may act independently in some lineages. Importantly, this study highlights the potential of using a multilineage approach when studying gene function during neural development in               Drosophila               .},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The neural mechanisms that balance waking and sleep to ensure adequate sleep quality in mammals are highly complex, often eluding functional insight. In the last two decades, researchers made impressive progress in studying the less complex brain of the invertebrate model organism               Drosophila melanogaster               , which has led to a deeper understanding of the neural principles of sleep regulation. Here, we will review these findings to illustrate that neural networks require sleep to undergo synaptic reorganization that allows for the incorporation of experiences made during the waking hours. Sleep need, therefore, can arise as a consequence of sensory processing, often signalized by neural networks as they synchronize their electrical patterns to generate slow-wave activity. The slow-wave activity provides the neurophysiological basis to establish a sensory gate that suppresses sensory processing to provide a resting phase which promotes synaptic rescaling and clearance of metabolites from the brain. Moreover, we demonstrate how neural networks for homeostatic and circadian sleep regulation interact to consolidate sleep into a specific daily period. We particularly highlight that the basic functions and physiological principles of sleep are highly conserved throughout the phylogenetic spectrum, allowing us to identify the functional components and neural interactions that construct the neural architecture of sleep regulation.},

This state transition results from deinactivation of a regenerative depolarizing event referred to as the low-threshold spike. Isolated adult guinea pig thalamic (dorsal lateral geniculate) neurons exhibited low-threshold spikes that could be blocked by low concentrations of nickel but were unaffected by the dihydropyridine nimodipine. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from these cells demonstrated a low-threshold, rapidly inactivating (T) Ca2+ current that manifested similar voltage dependency and time course as the low-threshold spike. Like low-threshold spikes, the T-type Ca2+ current was eliminated by nickel but was unaffected by nimodipine. In thalamic neurons, T-type Ca2+ channels underlie the low-threshold spike and, therefore, play a critical role in regulating the firing pattern of these cells.},

At 2 mM extracellular Ca2+ concentration, extracellular acidification in the pH range from 9.1 to 6.2 induced a positive shift of the activation curve and increased its slope factor. Both effects were significantly reduced if the concentration was increased to 20 mM or enhanced in the absence of Ca2+. Extracellular protons shifted the voltage dependence of the time constant of activation and decreased its voltage sensitivity, which excludes a voltage-dependent open pore block by protons as the mechanism modifying the activation curve. Changes in the extracellular pH altered the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation and deactivation kinetics in a Ca2+-dependent manner, but these effects were not strictly correlated with those on activation. Model simulations suggest that protons interact with intermediate closed states in the activation pathway, decreasing the gating charge and shifting the equilibrium between these states to less negative potentials, with these effects being inhibited by extracellular Ca2+. Extracellular acidification also induced an open pore block and a shift in selectivity toward monovalent cations, which were both modulated by extracellular Ca2+ and Na+. Mutation of the EEDD pore locus altered the Ca2+-dependent proton effects on channel selectivity and permeation. We conclude that Ca2+ modulates T-type channel function by competing with protons for binding to surface charges, by counteracting a proton-induced modification of channel activation and by competing with protons for binding to the selectivity filter of the channel.},

Although the activity dependence of synaptic efficacy has been studied extensively, less is known about how activity shapes the intrinsic electrical properties of neurons. Lobster stomatogastric ganglion neurons fire in bursts when receiving synaptic and modulatory input but fire tonically when pharmacologically isolated. Long-term isolation in culture changed their intrinsic activity from tonic firing to burst firing. Rhythmic stimulation reversed this transition through a mechanism that was mediated by a rise in intracellular calcium concentration. These data suggest that neurons regulate their conductances to maintain stable activity patterns and that the intrinsic properties of a neuron depend on its recent history of activation.},

T-type channels have been implicated in diverse physiological and pathophysiological processes, including epilepsy, autism, and mood regulation, but the brain structures involved remain incompletely understood. The medial habenula (MHb) is an epithalamic structure implicated in anxiety-like and withdrawal behavior. Previous studies have shown that MHb neurons fire tonic APs at a frequency of {$\sim$}2--10\,Hz or display depolarized low-amplitude membrane oscillations. Here, we report in C57BL/6J mice that a subpopulation of MHb neurons are capable of firing transient, high-frequency AP bursts mediated by T-type channels. Burst firing was observed following rebounding from hyperpolarizing current injections or during depolarization from hyperpolarized membrane potentials in {$\sim$}20\% of MHb neurons. It was rarely observed at baseline but could be evoked in MHb neurons displaying different initial activity states. Further, we show that T-type channel mRNA, in particular Ca               v               3.1, is expressed in the MHb in both cholinergic and substance P-ergic neurons. Pharmacological Ca               v               3 antagonism blocked both burst firing and evoked Ca               2+               currents in MHb neurons. Additionally, we observed high-frequency AP doublet firing at sustained depolarized membrane potentials that was independent of T-type channels. Thus, there is a greater diversity of AP firing patterns in MHb neurons than previously identified, including T-type channel-mediated burst firing, which may uniquely contribute to behaviors with relevance to neuropsychiatric disease.},

  abstract = {1. A model of the transient, low-threshold voltage-dependent (T-type) Ca2+ current is constructed using recent whole-cell voltage-clamp data from enzymatically isolated rat thalamocortical relay neurons. The T-type Ca2+ current is described according to the Hodgkin-Huxley scheme, using the m3h format, with rate constants determined from the experimental data (22-24 degrees C; extracellular Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]o = 3 mM). 2. The T-type Ca2+ current inactivates rapidly during maintained depolarization (time constant, Tau h approximately 20 ms at -20 mV), yet recovery from inactivation is slow (time constant, Tau r approximately 270 ms at -80 mV). To reconcile these observations, a two-step kinetic scheme is proposed for the inactivation gate. Each of the time constants in this scheme is voltage dependent, with a maximum at about -85 mV (45 ms for one and 275 ms for the other). 3. Numerical simulations of recovery in a two-pulse, voltage-clamp protocol compare favorably with experimental results obtained by Coulter et al. as well as those obtained in an independent series of experiments with guinea pig thalamic neurons ([Ca2+]o = 10 mM). 4. For current-clamp simulations, a leakage current gL (V-VL) is included; with VL = -65 mV, the calculated resting membrane potential is -63 mV. 5. It is shown that the T-type Ca2+ current together with the leakage current suffices to describe the low-threshold spike (LTS), a slow, triangular-shaped depolarizing event that can be evoked only from relatively hyperpolarized membrane potentials and that underlies the burst firing of Na(+)-dependent action potentials in thalamic neurons. Outward currents are not required to reproduce the basic shape of the LTS. 6. The LTS can be activated with either a depolarizing current step from a sufficiently hyperpolarized level or on termination of a hyperpolarizing current step. In either case, the amplitude of the LTS is a monotonically increasing, sigmoid-shape function of the hyperpolarizing current step intensity. 7. Because of the slower kinetic step of the channel's inactivation gate, our model predicts that recovery of the LTS to greater than one-half amplitude would require a prolonged hyperpolarization of greater than 100 ms (at body temperature). This imposes an upper limit (approximately 10 Hz) on the frequency of repetitive hyperpolarization that can elicit a train of LTSs and hence on the frequency of any rhythm that requires LTS-mediated bursting of thalamic neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Para/TipE sodium channels have biophysical and pharmacological properties similar to those of native channels. However, the pharmacology of these channels differs from that of vertebrate sodium channels: (a) toxin II from Anemonia sulcata, which slows inactivation, binds to Para and some mammalian sodium channels with similar affinity (Kd {$\cong$} 10 nM), but this toxin causes a 100-fold greater decrease in the rate of inactivation of Para/TipE than of mammalian channels; (b) Para sodium channels are \&gt;10-fold more sensitive to block by tetrodotoxin; and (c) modification by the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin is \&gt;100-fold more potent for Para than for rat brain type IIA sodium channels. Our results suggest that the selective toxicity of pyrethroid insecticides is due at least in part to the greater affinity of pyrethroids for insect sodium channels than for mammalian sodium channels.},

  abstract = {The ellipsoid body (EB) is a major structure of the central complex of the               Drosophila melanogaster               brain. Twenty-two subtypes of EB ring neurons have been identified based on anatomic and morphologic characteristics by light-level microscopy and EM connectomics. A few studies have associated ring neurons with the regulation of sleep homeostasis and structure. However, cell type-specific and population interactions in the regulation of sleep remain unclear. Using an unbiased thermogenetic screen of EB drivers using female flies, we found the following: (1) multiple ring neurons are involved in the modulation of amount of sleep and structure in a synergistic manner; (2) analysis of data for {$\Delta$}P(doze)/{$\Delta$}P(wake) using a mixed Gaussian model detected 5 clusters of GAL4 drivers which had similar effects on sleep pressure and/or depth: lines driving arousal contained R4m neurons, whereas lines that increased sleep pressure had R3m cells; (3) a GLM analysis correlating ring cell subtype and activity-dependent changes in sleep parameters across all lines identified several cell types significantly associated with specific sleep effects: R3p was daytime sleep-promoting, and R4m was nighttime wake-promoting; and (4) R3d cells present in 5HT7-GAL4 and in GAL4 lines, which exclusively affect sleep structure, were found to contribute to fragmentation of sleep during both day and night. Thus, multiple subtypes of ring neurons distinctively control sleep amount and/or structure. The unique highly interconnected structure of the EB suggests a local-network model worth future investigation; understanding EB subtype interactions may provide insight how sleep circuits in general are structured.                                         SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT               How multiple brain regions, with many cell types, can coherently regulate sleep remains unclear, but identification of cell type-specific roles can generate opportunities for understanding the principles of integration and cooperation. The ellipsoid body (EB) of the fly brain exhibits a high level of connectivity and functional heterogeneity yet is able to tune multiple behaviors in real-time, including sleep. Leveraging the powerful genetic tools available in               Drosophila               and recent progress in the characterization of the morphology and connectivity of EB ring neurons, we identify several EB subtypes specifically associated with distinct aspects of sleep. Our findings will aid in revealing the rules of coding and integration in the brain.},
